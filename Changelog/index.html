        <div id="summary" class="card">
			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/f/ff/Cybran_Wall.png"> Quick Summary</h3>
			There are many changes in this mod, but don't worry, you need to remember only a few of them! The rest are designed to bring improvements while not compromising your gameplay.
			<ul>
			<li> Mercies deal damage over time! Moving targets receive only a fraction of the damage.
			<li> Submarine warfare: Subs now counter suface ships; Sub Hunters counter subs and destroyers counter sub hunters!
            <li> Mass storages provide less adjacency and any mass stored in them is lost when they are destroyed.
			<li> RAS energy income has been nerfed, don't reclaim your pgens afterwards!
			<li> T4 units take much longer to build. Get t2/3 engineers, they are more efficient in this mod.
			<li> Veterancy doesn't instant-heal units anymore, don't rely on that when attacking with experimentals or your ACU.
			</ul>

			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/c/cf/Upgrade_Icon.png">Veterancy</h3>
			This is the first major change of the mod, which overhauls the veterancy system and also allows it to become a larger part of the game rather than being mostly irrelevant for everything except T4 units and ACUs.
            
			<p> Here are the rules the new veterancy system:
                <ul>
                <li>Units now receive veterancy points that are equal to the destroyed unit's mass cost. 
                <li>Units gain a veterancy level when they get 150% of their own mass cost in veterancy points.
                <li>ACUs & Experimentals require only 50% of their mass value to gain a rank. 
                <li>Destroying a unit with veterancy gives 20% more veterancy points per veterancy level of the destroyed unit. For example, killing a tank with 5 veterency levels awards 200% of its mass cost.
                <li>Multiple units killing the same target will split the veterency points between all units involved, in proportion to the damage dealt by each unit. A unit that deals 75% of the damage of a kill will be awarded 75% of that unit's mass in veterency points. <a href="http://recordit.co/t3kGOiPqcq">What that looks like.<a/>
                <p>
                <li>Promoted units receive new max health and gain higher regeneration, but  <a href="http://recordit.co/Y61oe1SANB"> no longer get any insta-heal<a/>. 
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>T1/T2/SACU</b> units gain <b>20%</b> more max HP.
                    <li><b>T3/ACU</b> units gain <b>15%</b> more max HP.
                    <li><b>Experimentals</b> gain <b>10%</b> more max HP. 
                    </ul>
                <p>
                <li>Regen values for units have been normalized and split into two categories. Main Combat Units recieve less regen at lower levels, but their regen bonuses are larger at higher veterency levels. Raider and Support units recieve a flat amount of regen each level.
                </ul>

                </ul>
			
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            
			<ul>
			<li>Rewarding killing expensive (and therefore high hp and powerfully-armed) units. A T3 scout worth 195m should not award the same veterency as destroying a T3 battleship worth 9000m.
			<li>To make veterancy a system which is intuitive and predictable for each unit. Units need to destroy 150% of their own mass to vet up.
			<li>Removing the unintuitive requirement of self destructing lower tech units to prevent the enemy from gaining ridiculous amounts of experience.
			<li>Filling new max HP faster and making units with veterancy more important overall. T3 and T4 units have less HP gains to increase the viability of using lower tech units against higher tech ones. Experimentals vet up faster but don't gain as much from doing so.
			<li>Splitting veterancy rewards. Your units should gain xp relatively evenly, rather than have one level 5 Loyalist after an exp battle.
			<li>A rebalance of regeneration rates. Regen helps different units gain the most from veterancy values. Raiding units which won't live long get regen faster than units which do, but max out at lower overall regen values, helping to highlight their roles and making the game more varied.
			<li>Naval units and submarines are far more expensive than land units and have far more HP, so they also gain more regeneration.
			</ul>

		<div id="reclaim" class="card">
			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/f/f5/Cybran_T1_Engineer.png"> Reclaim</h3>
			<h4>Purpose</h4>
            
			<p>Large reclaim fields provide something dynamic to fight over and adds variance to each game, but too often, entire fields are being reclaimed by one side before retaliation can be mounted by the other. Reclaim fields will last longer on the battlefield, requiring that you hold the field, rather than just dropping mass engineers.
			
			<ul>
			<li><b>The time needed to reclaim wrecks</b> is now twice as long. A unit with a build rate of 1 now reclaims at <strike>10m/s</strike> → 5m/s
            </ul>
            <p>SACU spam is an egregious example of this; not only are they strong in their own right, but if one dies, it could be reclaimed very quickly by the other SACUs near it and funneled into even more SACUs. SACU wrecks will now take additional time to reclaim on top of the increase to all wrecks.
			<ul>
            <li><b>SACU wrecks</b> now take twice as long as other wrecks to reclaim, taking four times as long to reclaim as the old FAF values.
            </ul>
            <p>Following the goal of keeping wreck fields on the battlefield longer, the Megalith has had its reclaim speed from building an egg on top of wrecks severly nerfed in order to keep it from nearly instantly reclaiming Experimental wrecks.
            <ul>
            <li><b>Megalith reclaim speed</b> -  <strike>1800m/s</strike> → 200m/s
            </ul>
            <p>In vanilla, a late-game air battle over the enemy's territory was a glorified mass donation. This led to long, drawn out games where a player with an economic or production advantage cannot leverage that advantage without an overwhelming lead. The FAF balance mod changed ASF wrecks to leave behind half the normal amount of mass in their wrecks; this is now being applied to Air Experimentals as well, to give players more freedom to use them over enemy territory.
            <ul>
            <li><b>Air experimental unit wrecks</b> contain - <strike>81% </strike> → 40.5% of original unit mass cost
            </ul>

			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/7/77/Cybran_T1_Land_Factory.png">Factories</h3>
			<p>Unit and Factory stats have been normalized to drain a constant amount of resources, so now it's much easier to predict how many factories you can support on X amount of eco.
			<p>Reduction of the amount of engineers one is required to have throughout the game. Support factories are built more quickly and are cheaper, and can support more aggressive gameplay. This speeds up the game slightly, and lets you put out a strong spam of any tech level if you commit to it.
			<p>Unassisted factories of the same tech level now drain resources at the same rate regardless of what is being built. A higher tech factory building lower tech units drains at the same rate, but builds units faster.
			<ul>
            <li><b>Factory Build Rates - T1 - T2 - T3</b>
            <li><b>Land:</b> <strike>20/40/90</strike> → 25/50/100 
			<li><b>Air:</b> <strike>20/40/120</strike> → 20/40/120 
			<li><b>Navy:</b> <strike>20/60/120</strike> → 20/60/180 
			<li><b>Quantum gateway:</b> <strike>120</strike> → 100

			<li><b>Factory Drain Rates - 	T1 - 	T2 - 	T3</b>
			<li><b>Land:</b> - 5m/25e - 10m/50e - 20m/200e
			<li><b>Air:</b> - 3m/50e - 7m/150e - 20m/1000e
			<li><b>Navy:</b> - 5m/50e - 15m/100e - 45m/450e
			</ul>
        Building/upgrading a factory has the same drain rate as building units inside the upgraded factory
			<ul>
			<li><b>Factory type - 	T1 - 	T2 - 	T3</b>

			210m 3500e 350bt - 630m 13500e  1800bt  - 3600m 120000e 9600bt

			300m 3000e 300bt  - 1350m 9000e 1800bt - 3600m 36000e 9000bt
			</ul>
			<ul>
            <li>T2/T3 support factories are built 3 times faster than HQs when upgraded from an existing factory.
            <li>In FAF, factories change their price depending on if you upgrade them or build with a higher tech engy. In equilibrium, the prices are tuned towards upgrading from existing factories, so building with engies may not give consistent drain values.
            <li>The dynamic price function was not fully working in FAF. It's been fixed in equilibrium; now the build time is also included in the dynamic price adjustment, so building with an engy is now done at the correct speed.
			</ul>
		
			
			<h4>Build time of experimentals</h4>
            Made experimentals slower to build overall. Experimentals should not be able to be built in the same amount of time as a few T3 tanks.
            <p>

			<ul>
			<li>T4 <b>land</b> units build <b>3</b> times faster than equivalent mass in a T3 factory
			<li>T4 <b>air</b> units build <b>4.8</b> times faster than equivalent mass in a T3 factory
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Factory HP</h4>
			Factory HP values were changed to be easier to snipe, encouraging thoughtful placement and shielding.
            <p>
			Since the Cybran naval factories are not able to be shielded, so to better protect them from snipes they now have the highest HP, rather than the lowest, in an ironic twist of faction diversity.

			<h4>Engineer cost changes</h4>
			Making buildpower easier to estimate. Nerfed the build rates on Aeon and Seraphim T3 engineers to bring them in line with the other two races, buffed engineering stations, and normalized all engineer costs to correspond to new factory build and drain rates.

            </ul>
			
			<h4>ACU build rates</h4>
            SACU default build rates decreased to help separate combat presets from eco and field engineer ones. This will create a real choice when deciding which to build.

			</ul>
			<h4>Sacrifice system</h4>
            Making the sacrifice system useful. Since engineers cost 5x more energy than mass, and most buildings cost 15x more energy than mass, engineers waste more mass than usual since the mass/energy ratio is different.
            <p> In Equilibrium, if an engineer assists a project with a lower mass:energy ratio than the engineer, instead of being wasted the leftover mass is left on the ground as a wreck.
			<ul>
			<li><b>T1/T2/T3 Aeon engineers:</b> <strike>60</strike> → 80% mass & energy value 
			<li><b>SACUs:</b> <strike>90</strike> → 80% mass value and <strike>90</strike> → 80% energy value

			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/2/2a/Cybran_T2_Mass_Extractor.png"> Economy</h3>
			
			<h4>Mex Changes</h4>
			The economy progression was smoothed out and made more early game than before, so you can get T2/T3 units faster but things like game enders come out later instead.
            <ul>
			<li>T2 mexes cost less mass to get players faster onto T2 eco, where the game becomes more interesting.
			<li>T3 mexes that are cheaper, but less effective especially with combination with less effective storages, this is a nerf to T3 eco, to smoothen the transition between T2/3 mexes.
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Mass storage</h4>
            Adjacency bonus decreased so players don't feel they have to put storages next to mexes, but still can.  HP and price decreased to make the storage better for storage purposes, not just eco.
            <p>
			Storage capacity removed from everything that isn’t an  ACU/SACU/storage
			<ul>
			<li><b>SACU storage capacity:</b> <strike>275m+0e</strike> → 500m+5000e
			</ul>
            
			<h4>Mass storage</h4>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Price change:</b> <strike>200m 1500e 250bt </strike> → 150m 1500e 187.5bt
			<li><b>Storage capacity:</b> <strike>500m</strike> → 1000m
			<li><b>Health:</b> <strike>1600</strike> → 750
			<li><b>Adjacency bonus:</b> <strike>50%</strike> → 25% efficiency when fully surrounded
            <li>The mass they store within them is now lost on death.
            <li>They now have a new strategic icon - its the same as before but without the tech bar at the bottom, so just like the energy storage.
			</ul>
			<h4>Mass extractors</h4>
			<ul>
			<li><b>T1:</b> <strike>36m 360e 60bt +2m-2e 600HP</strike> → 30m 300e 50bt +2m -1e 500HP
			<li><b>T2:</b> <strike>900m 5400e 1171bt +6m-12e 3000HP</strike> → 800m 6000e 1250bt +6m -10e 2000HP
			<li><b>T3:</b> <strike>4600m 31625e 3944bt +18m-46e 8400HP</strike> → 4000m 40000e 5000bt +16m -50e 6000HP
			</ul>
			<h4>Mass fabricators</h4>
			Making mass fabricators a more viable option. Their efficiency is the same, but they live longer, and need less power to support them. Mass fabs are great to put next to t3 factories, and also work next to pgens in grids, but they're not as efficient as t3 mexes.
			<ul>
			<li><b>T2:</b> <strike>100m 4000e 500bt +1 -150e 360HP 370dmg</strike> → 200m 4000e 312.5bt +1m -100e 500HP, 500dmg
			<li><b>T3:</b> <strike>3000m 65000e 4988bt +14m -3500e 6000HP death explosion 14aoe</strike> → 4000m 120000e 5000bt +16m -1500e 5000HP death explosion 10aoe
                <ul>
                <li>They now provide a <b>20%</b> adjacency bonus to all structures except quantum gateways.
                </ul>
			</ul>
			<h4>Energy storages</h4>
            Changed adjacency values for energy storage so that it's efficient to build it for economic reasons, not just for overcharging.
			<ul>
			<li><b>Price:</b> <strike>250m 1200e 200bt</strike> → 200m 2000e 250bt
			<li><b>Storage capacity:</b> <strike>5000e</strike> → 8000e
			<li><b>Adjacency bonus:</b> <strike>50%</strike> → +100% efficiency when fully surrounded
			</ul>
			<h4>Power generators:</h4>
			<ul>
            <li><b>Hydrocarbon power plant:</b> <strike>1600HP</strike> → 1500HP
			<li><b>T1 pgen:</b> <strike>600HP 2aoe death explosion</strike> → 500HP 2.5aoe death explosion
			<li><b>T2 pgen:</b> <strike>2198bt 2120HP</strike> →  1875bt 2000HP
			<li><b>T3 pgen:</b> <strike>3240m 9640HP 8000dmg</strike> → 3200m 8000HP  7500dmg explosion
			</ul>
			<h4>Resource Allocation System</h4>
            RAS is, quite frankly, OP. There is rarely a time where you don't want it, or a time where you would ever build a T3 pgen before getting RAS. RAS has been nerfed to increase the value of pgens, which opens up more strategic choices and new ways to attack your opponent. 
			<ul>
			<li><b>Cybran:</b> <strike>12m 3500e</strike> 12m 2100e
			<li><b>UEF:</b> <strike>14m 3300e</strike> 14m 1800e 
			<li><b>Seraphim:</b> <strike>16m 3000e</strike> 16m 1500e / <strike>32m 6000e</strike> 32m 2700e
			<li><b>Aeon:</b> <strike>18m 2700e</strike> 18m 1200e / <strike>36m 5400e</strike> 36m 2100e
			</ul>

		<div id="acus" class="card">
			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/7/7b/Cybran_ACU.png">ACUs & Upgrades</h3>
			
            <h4>ACU Price</h4>
			To make the ACU eventually repairable and work correctly with the new veterancy system.
            <ul>
			<li><b>ACU Cost</b> (not normally seen/used): <strike>18Km 50Ke 6M bt</strike> → 2 000m 48000e 20 000bt
            </ul>
			
			
            <h4>Main gun</h4>
			The gun range is nerfed to keep it in line with the other changes and keep ranges consistent throughout the mod.
            <p>The turret turn rate helps with microing the acu when it switches targets - makes it nicer to use.
                <ul>
                <li><b>Range:</b> <strike>22</strike> → 23
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Gun upgrade range:</b> <strike>30</strike> → 28
                    <li><b>Aeon gun upgrade range:</b> <strike>35</strike> → 33
                    </ul>
                <li><b>Turret turn rate:</b> <strike>90°</strike> → 100°/s
                </ul>
            
			<h4>Overcharge</h4>
            Overchange was a somewhat strange mechanic which was really strong against t2/3 units, and was not obvious to newer players that you require an energy storage to use it.
            <p> In Equilibrium, overcharge now does variable damage, depending on how much energy is drained. To stop it from being too strong against experimentals but still try to keep the overall energy drain as low as possible, reload time has been increased, so you can't destroy experimentals really quickly if you store up the energy. Overall this is a big nerf to late game OC and a buff to early game OC.
            
                <ul>
                <li>The damage increases in steps of 1000 up to 15 000 per shot
                <li><b>Energy drained per 1000 damage:</b> 2000, up to 30 000 per shot when dealing 15 000 damage.
                <li>Special code prevents units from being overkilled and wasting your energy. OC always aims to kill whatever it hits in one shot.
                <li>Buildings take <b>15%</b> damage from OC, so from <b>150</b> up to <b>2250</b> per shot.
                <li>ACUs take <b>10%</b> damage from OC, so from <b>100</b> up to <b>1500</b> per shot.
                <li><b>Reload time:</b> <strike>3.3</strike> → 5s
                </ul>
			
			<h4>Cybran base regeneration</h4>
            
			To make Cybran acu more consistent with the others
            
                <ul>
                <li><b>Regeneration:</b> <strike>17</strike> → 15HP/s
                </ul>
			
			<h4>T2 upgrade</h4>
            
            Making T2 more useful for building, and less for fighting, for fighting there is a different upgrade, Aeon and Cybran have more because they can't have gun + T2.
            
                <ul>
                <li><b>Price:</b> <strike>720m 18000e 900bt</strike> → 700m 14000e 700bt
                <p>
                <li><b>UEF/Seraphim:</b> <strike>+3000</strike> → +1000HP
                <li><b>Aeon:</b> <strike>+3000</strike> → +1500HP
                <li><b>Cybran:</b> <strike>+3500</strike> → +2000HP
                </ul>
			
			<h4>T3 upgrade</h4>
            
            Price changed for to give a constant drain of 10m/s 200e/s, and less HP since veterancy has been changed, and it would be a serious gain to the total HP of the ACU, especially for Seraphim with double nano, that would survive a nuke.
            
                <ul>
                <li><b>Price:</b> <strike>2400m 8400bt +6000/7000HP</strike> → 2500m 5000bt +4000HP
                </ul>
            
			<h4>RAS/ARAS</h4>
			Drains 20m/500e, making it much easier to get without ruining eco or pausing.
            
                <ul>
                <li><b>Price:</b> <strike>150 000e 1400bt</strike> →  125000e 2500bt
                <li><b>Cybran:</b> <strike>12m 3500e</strike> 12m 2100e
                <li><b>UEF:</b> <strike>14m 3300e</strike> 14m 1800e 
                <li><b>Seraphim:</b> <strike>16m 3000e</strike> 16m 1500e / <strike>32m 6000e</strike> 32m 2700e
                <li><b>Aeon:</b> <strike>18m 2700e</strike> 18m 1200e / <strike>36m 5400e</strike> 36m 2100e
                </ul>
            
			<h4>Teleport</h4>
            
			More consistent drain values when upgrading. A little improvement for all teleport animation. Fixed a bug where the sound did not go away after cancelling tele or teleporting.
            
                <ul>
                <li><b>Price:</b>  <strike>4200bt</strike> → 5000bt
                <li><b>Cybran:</b> Re-added teleport effect
                </ul>
            
			<h4>TML</h4>
            
			Making it harder to kill an enemy ACUs at close ranges with ACU TML, and preventing it from being able to destroy TMD in some cases. UEF missile get camera vision as faction trait to support they position as turtle-war specialist
            
                <ul>
                <li><b>Price:</b> <strike>1500m</strike> → 1200m 60000e 1200bt
                <li><b>Minimum range:</b> <strike>5</strike> → 15
                <li><b>Missile HP:</b><strike>3</strike> →  2HP
                <li><b>UEF:</b> Added camera vision on missile 10aoe 10s 
                </ul>
			
			<h4>Aeon upgrades</h4>
            Chrono: lowered price and effectiveness, making it a safer, more consistent upgrade, hoping that it will be seen more in game, because it’s an interesting option that is underused.
                <ul>
                <li><b>Omni Sensor:</b> <strike>10000e 500bt</strike> → 8000e 400bt

                <li><b>Chrono dampener:</b> <strike>1750m 5250e 1225bt 200e/shot</strike> → 1500m 60 000e 1500bt drain 400e/shot
                    <ul>
                    <li><strike>35r, 3.5s stun, 5s reload time</strike> → 33r, 2s stun, 4s reload time
                    <li>20HP/s regeneration added.
                    <li>Now fires automatically at all available targets, including air/naval.
                    <li>Now works from transports and underwater.
                    </ul>
                </ul>
			
			<h4>UEF upgrades</h4>
            Nano needed a small buff since it was quite bad. The HP helps with survivability and veterancy for the ACU, a true offensive upgrade.
            <p>Compared to Aeon the UEF shield costs less mass but more energy.
            <p>The shoulder drones got some quality-of-life improvements to make them nicer to use - they now upgrade alongside tech upgrades for your acu, increasing their build power. They are also cheaper to rebuild than to build.
            <p>The Billy is now a more consistent weapon, where it's easier to defend against, but more dangerous against T3 land units. Also get camera vision to watch such nice explosion from first seat!
            
                <ul>
                <li><b>Drone:</b> 150m 2250e 300bt
                    <ul>
                    <li>Now scale buildpower with acu tech level, with special effects added so show that. This buildpower bonus is lost if the acu tech upgrade is removed.
                    <li><b>Buildpower T1/2/3:</b> 5/10/20
                    <li><b>Rebuild cost:</b> 75m 750e 15s (set time)
                    </ul>
                <li><b>Nano:</b> 48000e 1200bt
                    <ul>
                    <li>adds +2000HP

                    <li><b>Minimum range:</b> <strike>5</strike> → 25
                    <li><b>Damage:</b> <strike>12000 15aoe + 250dmg on 25aoe</strike> → 9000dmg on 15aoe + 1000dmg on 25aoe
                    <li>Added camera vision on missile 20aoe 10s 
                    </ul>
                </ul>
			
			<h4>Cybran upgrades</h4>
            Laser: For more fluent numbers
            <p>Torpedo:Its hard to counter the Cybran ACU with torpedo upgrade early on, so its nerfed a little. Its firing pattern was adjusted as part of the submarine rework.
            <p>Stealth: Since the Cybran ACU has low hp, it gets some regen on its stealth upgrade so its got a strong combination like gun+T2 for the other factions.
            <p>Cloak: Making it cheaper so it can be used more often, because it’s an interesting part of the game. The regen is added to make it a bit more defensive.
            
                <ul>
                <li><b>Laser:</b> 4200m 560 000e
                <li><b>Torpedo:</b> <strike>37500e</strike> → 45000e adjusted firing pattern

                <li><b>Cloak:</b> <strike>6000m 750 000e, 4200bt, -3000e/s</strike> → 5000m 625 000e 2500bt -2500e/s drain
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Regeneration:</b> <strike>0</strike> → 20hp/s
                    <li>Adds max <strike>15000HP</strike> → 13000HP
                    </ul>
                </ul>
			
			<h4>Seraphim upgrades</h4>
            
            Restoration Field: It's hard to compare the Sera Regen field to gun, so now its a choice between having a stronger acu, or a stronger army. More HP and regen to allow the acu to stay in fights longer. Reducing max regeneration on advanced restoration field is for a reason: to prevent abuse. Did you know that a single full vet Seraphim destroyer (surfaced) with an ACU with resto field can quite easily beat a battleship?
            <p>Heavy gun: The range increase and price change helps it be used more often in the game, because it was simply too expensive for what it did.
            
                <ul>
                <li><b>Regen field price:</b> <strike>600m 4500e 600bt</strike> 600m 18000e 600bt 
                    <ul>
                    <li>Fixed bug where regen rate gets reduced to its maximum for units that have more regen.
                    <li>Fix bug with regen aura that causes wierd behavior when near another Seraphim acu with advanced regen aura.

		<h2>Land</h2>
		
        In this mod land units are adjusted to keep the same purposes but to make gameplay more consistent (less random BS) and make tech level progression not so steep - so you can use lower tech units more effectively later on, rather than having to crtl-k them for mass.
            
            <ul>
			<li>T1 units have more HP, and less dps, in total with the same efficiency, but give more time while they are being killed = can be used as a meat shield for higher tech armies that have a larger range

			<h4>Labs</h4>
            Making labs usable not only at the start of the game, more speed to be better for raiding; they have had a huge buff, but don’t worry they still lose to tanks in direct combat in larger numbers! However you can now use them with a T1/2 army as well.
			<li>Changed target priorities to something more logical: where you kill radar first, and then ACU for easier ghetto snipes.
            <li>The personal cloak on the Selen was made easier to use, and the unit is now more like a lab, with improved maneuverability and it's now able to shoot while moving properly.
            <li>The Flare now creates a large vision radius when it dies, living up to its name. Its intended to be used in combination with Auroras, giving them the intel they need to use their range.
            <li>The Mech Marine is the strongest lab, but doesnt have any abilities.
               
                <ul>
                <li>Changed target priority to ACU -> mobile radar -> T1/2/3... + display "ghetto" on unit (except Seraphim)
                <li>Veterancy multiplier 2.5 so it vet for +- same speed as t1 tanks
                <li>Reduced ROF of LABs on transports to 75% of normal

			<h4>Mobile AA</h4>
			This unit was in sore need of a buff, almost never being used, so it got one both in HP and DPS. Its speed was increased to chase bombers better, and to be worth building in the first place, now it can also hit interceptors.
            
            <p>AA units have only AA weapon and when are mixed in army then don't react on ground attack order. We fix this problem so now they don't stay on place. 
            
            <p>The Cybran MAA is also usable like a weaker aurora, with the same range. The ground projectile now tracks its target, to make it more consistent. It’s slower than other mobile AA so it has more range to compensate.
                
                <ul>
                The ghetto function is a fun feature, like mantis repair. It's nearly useless but maybe it can have a creative use sometimes. Their range is reduced in transports so they don't outrange interceptors, and can't kite them.

			<h4>Mobile Artillery</h4>
            T1 Mobile artillery: mostly unchanged, but it needed some adjustments to fit in with the balance and got some quality-of-life changes.
            <p>Medusa: Stun added against T3 units, dps added to make it less annoying to use vs pd, so price is also increased.
            <p>Fervor: Compensating for the aurora losing range, their main advantage on T1, the fervor was made better for use against land units (and acu). 
            <p>Lobo: vision time increase to give this feature more potential. AOE increased to help it compete with other artillery.
                <ul>

			<h4>Tanks</h4>
			T1 now tanks live longer, so take a longer time to defend against push. Also can be a better meat shield for higher tech units, so they are more useful in late game.
            <p>Speed decreased to let LABs have more room for raiding.
            <p>Mantis now have a tank icon so you can separate them from labs, which are now usable in your main army. More build rate so the assist feature is used more often, less dps, but better damage per shot. It’s mainly a nerf for Cybran, where they have additional damage from MAA, basically for free now.

			<h4>Mobile missile launchers</h4>
            
			These units were tweaked a bit to have some more faction diversity and make them more interesting overall.
            <p>
            <li><b>Seraphim:</b> This factions trait is to have fewer, more versatile, multifunctional units, such as their T2 destroyers taking on the role of T2 submarines. Their T2 land is not very diverse. This change makes MML also usable against land units on a shorter range, making it follow the factional design philosophy.

			What I tried to achieve with T3 balance is to have a T3 tech which doesn't make T2 units obsolete, but does give an advantage. Currently T1/2 units very quickly become useless as soon as the T3 level is reached, which I think is quite sad since T2 has all the support units that should be used with t3, instead of just brick spam.

            Experimentals in this game were not in the right spot - they were more of a cheese unit than a true experimental. Their incredibly fast build time leads to teams rushing a monkey and the difference between a victory and a mass donation relying on whether the opponent scouts you 10 seconds later, which is not a consistent way of winning the game. Because of this the experimentals are very weak in direct, fair combat. I increased their buildtime and make them less cheese and more strategic instead.
            
            <h4>General</h4>
			T3 units are weaker in this mod (-25%dps -35%HP), so experimentals are changed to maintain balance.
                <ul>
                <li>Experimentals have roughly <b>15%</b> less HP than before
                <li>The GC, Monkeylord, Megalith, Ythotha and the Fatboy now prioritise the ACU over everything else.
                </ul>

                </ul>
			
            <h4>Ythotha</h4>
			Its price increased because Ion storm is now extremely useful for supporting your army.
                <ul>
                <li><b>Price:</b>  <strike>25 000m 18 750bt 67 000HP</strike> → 28 000m 46666bt 60 000HP

                </ul>
			
            <h4>Fatboy</h4>
			Its DPS was moved from long range to short, because T3 units have less HP, and dps, short range is less annoying and gives more time for opponents to deal with the fatboy.
                <ul>
                <li><b>Price:</b>  <strike>21 000bt 32500HP -500e/s 180br</strike> → 46 660bt 35 000HP -250e/s 200br

                </ul>
			
			<h4>Scathis</h4>
			The Scathis was a very cheap game ender on small maps, and useless on larger ones. We gave it a new role, embracing the concept of mobile artillery.
				<ul>
				<li>Reworked as a mobile artillery piece, with more versatility but far less destructive power.
				<li>It now has EMP which makes it great for supporting armies.
                <li>It can now move faster, but is slow to accelerate.
                <li>It is now able to support navies by firing from underwater - this is only useful on mostly water maps since on land you can have it shielded, and it is vulnerable to torpedo bombers.

            Previously OP, the SACUs have received a much needed rebalance in this mod. Here extra care was taken to ensure that all the presets can be used in various situations, and even SACUs without presets. In general SACUs have a more supporting role and work well when mixed in with T3 units.

			<p>
			<i>Note: Quantum gateways drain 40m/2000e when producing most SACUs</i>
            <p>
            
            <h4>General</h4>
			Price and range reduced to make SACUs weaker without any upgrades, but worth building like presets, opening a new role for SACUs.
			<p>With reduced buildpower and more time to be reclaimed SACU there is less chance that SACU spam will reclaim anything that dies immediately after the battle.
			<p>The death explosions make SACU spam more risky since it could start a chain reaction, also it’s possible to use as a kamikaze weapon, especially with RAS upgrade that increase damage. Damage type changed to prevent teleportation snipes of important buildings by dieing next to them.

			<h4>Aeon</h4>
            
			<p>Sacrifice removed: because it was a useless upgrade, and it’s much better to have nano in it’s place so you have a military upgrade on each slot. Now sacrifice is part of the rapid fabricator.

			<h4>UEF</h4>
            
			<li>Jamming is cheaper, because it’s not used often and it buffs pure support SACUs.

                </ul>
						
			<h4>Cybran</h4>
            
			<li>Lots of HP and lack of dps: to increase faction diversity, and for AA/EMP that will be stronger without any extra upgrades.
			<li>Stealth: changed to a stealth field, to encourage use as a support SACU.
			<li>EMP: Stun changed to be less op against T3 units.
			<li>Nano: regeneration decreased because T3 units have less dps.
			<li>Cloak: buffed so it's used more often.

                </ul>
			
			<h4>Seraphim</h4>
            
			<li>Decreased passive resource generation to make them like the other factions, it was a big buff, and Seraphim SACUs are already the best fighters so they don’t need another advantage for free. 
			<li>Swapped the positions of the rapid fabricator with teleport so you can have combat engineer SACUs.
			<li>TML is more expensive but has more aoe, and more importantly can store up to 3 missiles which can annihilate an incoming army from huge ranges.
			<li>Overchange: less dps and rof so it's not as OP, more aoe so it's better against units when it fires, range bonus so you don't need to have sensor upgrade for it to be effective, because the default range is 23.

            <li>Air Staging facilities now repair for free.
			</ul>
            
            <li>Gunships are not able to fire on air units with ground fire weapon anymore

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>To re-enable the fuel mechanic which is currently non-existent and to give air staging facilities and carriers a purpose again, leading in general to more selective and locational use of air, rather than just denying all air after 1 fight.
            <li>Airstaging was needed at T1, and was priced like a T1 building, so it was moved there for convenience.
            <li>The free repair prevents them from seizing up when you are stalling, and effectively trapping your aircraft in them.

            <h4>Scouts</h4>
            
            Price changed to standardise the factory drain values and to help promote scouting.

            <h4>Interceptors</h4>
            
            Less energy cost and more mass cost to make tech switching is easier and to encourage each player in a team game to build some air. The speed increase helps catch strats.
                <ul>

                </ul>
            
            <h4>Bombers</h4>
            
            Buffed bombers, to make them easier to use, since they make the game more interesting and to keep them in line since MAA is buffed in this mod. There is now much less reason to hoverbomb since they bombers have a much improved turning circle.
                <ul>
                
                    <p><b>Aeon:</b> Increasing faction diversity, the Aeon bomber is better for single targets, and higher tech units; the emp can also support your army, but it’s less useful for armies, unlike Seraphim with its large aoe.

            <h4>Jester</h4>
            
            First jester is not an issue, so it can be of a similar mass efficiency to T2 gunships, also the buff helps maintain its effectiveness since T1/2 MAA has been buffed here.
                <ul>

            <h4>T1 transports</h4>
            
            Transports are underused and make the gameplay more dynamic and interesting, so I tried to encourage transport usage. Speed increased since interceptors have more speed, and they can drop into more dangerous territory now. Additionally, any units being transported now leave wrecks correctly if the transport is shot down.

            <h4>Torpedo bombers</h4>
            
            Torpedo Bombers are slightly better with a bit more speed and turn rate. They were given depth charges to make the more consistent, also cleaning up buggy code in the process.

            <h4>T2 Fighter/bombers</h4>
            
			T2 air needed to be better against T3 air, so T2fighter/bombers cost less, have less ground damage and health, but AA dps is unchanged. Also the Notha firing tolerance changed so it doesn't miss as much. 
                <ul>
                <p>Target priorities to make using them less frustrating
                <p>Corsair AA was buffed to be more similar to other T2 bombers (still much worse)
                <p>Swift winds have a higher price and receive more HP to maintain their advantage as the best T2 AA fighter.

            <h4>Mercy</h4>
            
			Mercies have been reworked to be better against sniping buildings, and worse for ACU snipes - an ACU moving away will receive only ~30% of the full damage. Crash damage was increased so that the mercy is only 99% useless if it gets shot down and because it makes more sense for a flying bomb to deal some damage on falling.

            <h4>T2 transports</h4>
            
			Transports got some regeneration to make them reusable without needing to pay attention to repair them, more speed because interceptors are also faster. Additionally, any units being transported now leave wrecks correctly if the transport is shot down.

			Increased faction diversity between Spy planes:
                <ul>
                <p>Cybran added stealth toggle, and energy consumption, so it's in line with the other stealthed aircraft.
                <p>Seraphim doesn’t have any advanced intel like the other factions ( eye of rihane, Soothsayer, novax) so you can place it in the enemy base similar to Selens.

            <h4>ASF</h4>
            
            ASF were just unbelievably OP. Their price was increased to allow more time for T2 units, before the inevitable ASF swarm arrives. They have less speed, more reload time, less dps to make them less superior (brutally unstoppable with air) and allow T2 air to compete (but still lose), more turret yaw/pitch range to give less random results in air combat (this is the cone where asf can fire). And even after such nerfs they are still superior.

            <h4>T3 Gunships + special</h4>
            
            T3 gunships are a very interesting but underused unit so they got cheaper, with the same effectiveness so you can build them more often (also buffed a bit).
                <ul>
                <p>Cybran got stealth instead of jamming so you can have fully stealthed T3 air, and because it’s a Cybran trait, allowing them to have a fully stealthed t3 air.
                <p>UEF got jamming because it’s more of a UEF trait.
                <p>Aeon restorer is adjusted slightly so it’s the same as before relative to changed air.
                <p>Continental: Less energy consumption and less AA dps  - better than making it stupidly expensive. Its shield bubble is also slightly bigger so it can be combined with T3 gunships and cover them.

            <h4>T3 bombers</h4>
            
            Strats were a bit of a cheese unit so they have less speed and HP so they can be countered with T1/2 air, they got some damage tweaks to make them more consistent, more reload time so they doesn’t destroy mexes too well while hover bombing.
                <ul>
                <p>Cybran strat was nerfed with less survivability and more energy maintenance since stealth is a huge advantage and it now destroys T2 mex in a single pass as others.

            <h4>General</h4>
            
            Air experimentals dont live long in enemy territory and so need this change to be able to operate there while giving less of a mass donation. This is the same for ASF in normal FAF.

            </ul>
            
            <h4>Soul Ripper</h4>
            Soul Ripper: decreased its mass cost, because it's not much stronger than a GC -  when instant heal doesn't exist air exps are weaker (and are less cheese). More crash damage, because it's a very big unit.

            <h4>Ahwassa</h4>
            
 			Reduced speed so it's easier to catch up to. Also its range was reduced so its not so easy to abuse its hover bombing ability to out-range SAMs (rather than making it possible but super annoying). Like other air exps, it got a boost to its AA dps, but we were careful not to make it OP, so it has reduced range because of that.

			CZAR: It was a useless unit, that could help only due to its massive crash damage. But the CZAR is an experimental fortress, not a mercy. Massive increases to its HP and AA effectiveness help it be at least a little useful against air, and less against land. Now a CZAR can destroy 50-75% of its own mass in asf.
                <ul>
                <p>The beam damage was changed to be more effective against buildings, and less against moving land units, and depth charge dps was increased so that they’re not absolutely useless. 
                <p>The CZARs speed was reduced to make it less about cheese and more about strategy, and also helping ground AA counter it (20-25% mass in land AA destroys a CZAR)

            Navy had the best tech level balance in FAF, but there are still some small things which could be ironed out. Several non-naval units were also introduced to the naval game to make it more refreshing and diverse, such as mobile shields.
            <p>
            Submarines in the naval game are a little underused, and things have been shifted around to make them more useful and interesting. I made every unit useful even on the T3 stage, by using a very old balance model all the way from GPG pre-beta, then making it all work with the help of torpedo defenses.
            <p>
            As a whole, surface warfare is largely unchanged, but submarines and other support units should be seen more often.
            
            <ul>
            <li>Units deeper than <b>1 unit</b> underwater no longer recieve any damage from surface weapons! You can still groundfire units in shallow water, but in deep water it has no effect! (Original work by Balthazar)
            <li>Sonar always has greater or equal range than water-vision, which makes sonar redundant anyway.
            <li>All <b>T1 attack submarines</b> are now effective against <b>surface ships</b>. Getting mass T1 sub spam can work all the way into the late T3 stage, but expect to be countered.
            <li><b>T2 Sub Hunters</b> now actually have the role of hunting <b>subs</b>. They have very low HP and very strong torpedo defense for this purpose, and can kite T1 subs
            <li><b>Surface ships</b> already have high HP and are now equipped with depth charges, which bypass the <b>sub hunters'</b> torpedo defenses and easily kill them.
            <li>Some naval had torpedo flares but they displayed as <b>torpedo defence</b>, in EQ we differentate between the two and the units have the <b>torpedo flare</b> ability.
            <li>To prevent "great submarine micro" where you stack them all in one spot to increase torpedo defense effectiveness, all torpedoes and depth charges have 0.5AOE. Don't stack your submarines. Just don't.
            <li>All torpedo/depth charge weapons have new target priorities which focus subhunters first. This is because they have their torp defense and the least HP and so are optimal targets.
            <li>As always, Seraphim being the faction with no units, they are special and have a T1 submarine which is better against subhunters. Their destroyer now has a reason to be submerged; it acts like an attack submarine.

            <h4>Frigates</h4>
            Frigates are now a powerful intel unit. Other ships rely on them for intel rather than just HP sinks.
                <ul>
                <p>AA nerfed on the Trident Class. The Cybrans have a very solid cruiser and T2 submarines; they dont need op frigates anymore.
                <p>The Shard now has more HP, so it doesn't get killed in one pass by torpedo bombers. It also has torpedo defense to help against submarines.
                <p>The Beacon has more range than others but less speed, micro will make it more effective than other frigates.

            T1 Attack submarines get their originally intended role. Their job is to sink ships. And they got some serious buffs to enable that.  
                <ul>
                <p>T1 submarine are stronger and more expensive units, main reason for this is neglect unit pathfinding problems. 
                <p>The deck gun range was reduced because it outranged frigates which would have made submarines very strong early game for raiding mexes.
                <p>The Aeon submarine is faster because it doesn’t have a deck gun, which can be a huge disadvantage.
                <p>The Seraphim submarine is different as usual. It has less HP but torpedo defense to cover up for it. This defense is very strong in large numbers.

            <h4>Support units</h4>
            
            Regen added because they can't get veterancy.
                <ul>
                <p>Mermaid: These boats provide a huge stealth advantage. The price increase should balance that and the crazy anti-torp stacking they have.
                <p>Bulwark: Price changed to standardise factory drain values. Lower range on its shield so you need more bulwarks to completely cover your navy. (it's one of the main reasons why UEF navy is OP)
                
                <li><b>Mermaid:</b> <strike>600m 6000e 1500HP 0reg</strike> → 750m 7500e 1900HP 5HP/s reg <strike>62sonar 60radar</strike> → 32sonar 32radar

                </ul>
         
            <h4>T2 Submarine Hunters</h4>
            
            Sub hunters: They were given their original pre-beta role. Now they really do hunt submarines, due to their extremely powerful torpedo defense, with which they can protect a whole fleet.
                <ul>
                <p>Cooper: Nerfed a little so it's not better against destroyers than a destroyer (when microed).
                
                <li><strike>1100m 8800e 4400bt; 20water-vision, 32vision-radius; -1.5 elevation</strike> → 1050m 7000e 4200bt; 20water-vision, 20vision-radius; -2.5 elevation

                </ul>
         
            <h4>Cruisers</h4>
            
            Cruisers got their price changed to standardise factory drain values.
                <ul>
                <p>Infinity Class: Tiny buff to its tiny ground weapon to help make it more convenient by making it stay further behind due to its larger range.
                <p>Siren Class: Since cybrans don't have shields, their cruiser gets more HP to survive longer vs torps. With more HP, and less dps it will buy more time for the rest of the cybran navy to deal damage, due to the decentralised nature of their AA dps. Since it's also better in surface warfare you can build these more often into your navy, but they are completely defenseless vs submerged threats.
                    <ul>
                    <li>Toggle on its AA removed to fix a poorly implemented function where players can't tell if it's set to engage air or land. Now it will manage itself.
                    </ul>
                <p>The seraphim cruiser got a quality of life change to its flak weapon - more muzzle velocity, less dps to make it more consistent.
                
                <li><b>Price:</b> <strike>2000m 18000e 8000bt</strike> → 1950m 13000e 7800bt

                    <li>Removed the toggle for its AA weapon → now it's automatic
                    <li>Its toggled missiles track their targets as well, so this feature is stronger.
                    <li>Set up correct target priorities on its toggled missiles.
                    </ul>

                </ul>
           
            <h4>Destroyers</h4>
            
            Destroyers got their water vision reduced as part of the submarine rework. They now have more aoe and muzzle velocity so they're able to hit small land units, which were nearly immune to destroyers. They now shoot depth charges which are great against subhunters but their low dps is not good against massed attack submarines. Faster depth-charges projectile to reduce overkill. They got a new strategic icon to show their role better, since they're now a lot less anti-naval focused.
                <ul>
                <p>Exodus: aoe increased to fix the lack of a T2 land bombardment unit without messing up naval balance.
                <p>Valiant: Due to its shorter range its a little faster to prevent infinite kiting.

            <h4>T3 Submarines</h4>
            
            Submarines sit deeper in the water so it's not as easy to groundfire them; their range was decreased so you can counter them properly instead of groundfire. 
                <ul>
                <p>Strategic submarines are cheaper because they are underused and make the game more fun. Plan B reworked to increase faction diversity and to make it usable against navy, it’s not as good as Seraphim sub hunters, but it can compete.

                <p>Summit dps and muzzle velocity reduced to make it more balanced against navy.

            <h4>T4 Submarines</h4>
            The naval experimentals were somewhat lackluster so they got some improvements to make them more powerful but not so easy to get. Both the Atlantis and Tempest got special seabed detection code so they don't clip through the floor as much anymore, stopping their torpedoes from firing.
            
                <ul>
                <p>Atlantis is faster so it’s not a sea snail. Regen added because every T4 has natural regen. 
                <p>Tempest build time increased by a lot (4x), fixed so it's a real experimental - it still loses against equal mass in battleships or subs but now it has a reason to be built, aside from a stupidly fast build time.

            <h4>Torpedo Launchers</h4>
            
            Torpedo launchers are intended as a kinda of point defense for the sea - they are effective against everything in their range but most ships outange them.
            
                <ul>
                <p>T1 torpedo launchers are much better for killing early submarines.
                <p>T2 torpedo launchers get stealth so there is at least some reason to build them. Their HP was increased so they can handle everything that gets in their range.
                <p>The HARMS received a <a href="http://recordit.co/XqSCJQShKH"> rework to its deployment<a/> - now it sinks to the sea floor and deploys there, with extra visual effects. It still fires torpedoes, so it's countered by subhunters, but everything else is in danger. Its firing pattern was adjusted so its not completely useless vs subhunters though.

            This unit was nearly useless due to its firing randomness and cost, it was only worth building them against fatboys and in some cases Cybran T2 navy. In this mod they are reworked to be a T2 version of T3 artillery. Very expensive, but can be serious threat for the enemy base or an incoming army. A game ender on 5x5 1v1 maps and a major investment in teamgames. Faction diversity was also increased, where different factions have different artillery.

            <h4>Tactical missile launchers</h4>
            
            AOE increased to kill storage around mexes when targetting them. It is also better at hitting moving units now, to make using this against armies more viable. The amount of missiles TMLs can store has also been decreased, since you never need 20 and forgetting to disable autobuild will waste eco.

            <h4>T2 Stealth Field generators</h4>
            The stealth generators get some changes to make them more interesting to use by enabling new strategies and to increase faction diversity.
            
            
                <ul>
                <p>Aeon get to protect their stealth generator if it gets under attack by packing it up. In return for disabling stealth it recieves a considerable HP boost while in its packed state.
                <p>The UEF also get a jamming generator on their building, which for some extra energy drain creates fake building blips, making the enemy suspect PD placement.
                <p>Seraphim personal cloak was added so that this building is fully invisible, except for a visual effect. This makes it easier to use offensively since the generator itself is harder to find. To prevent it from being used as a stealth intel system, its visiol radius was reduced.
                <li>added 'DEFENSE' category → sparky can build them
                <p>
                <li><b>Aeon:</b> <strike>726/664bt</strike> → 500bt

            <h4>Radar</h4>
            
                <ul>
                <p>T1/2 Radar: resource adjusted to fit equilibrium's building pattern where units of the same type and tech drain same resources while being built.
                <p>T3 Radar: On the most popular maps its enough to place one somewhere in your back base and its enough to see the whole map. We just made it require a little more strategic placement and use of (gasp) multiple radars on larger maps.
                
                <li><b>T1 Radar:</b> <strike>80m 720e 80bt 14.08br</strike> → 100m 1000e 100bt 12.5br

                    </ul>
                </ul>
            <p>
            
            <h4>Cybran T3 Perimeter Monitoring System</h4>
            
            This is a very expensive and rarely used building, and needed more HP so its harder to snipe and the reclaim doesnt get damaged as much.
            
                <ul>
                <li><b>Price:</b> <strike>4800m 60000e 1195bt, 500HP</strike> →  4500m 90000e 5625bt 2750HP
                </ul>
                
            <h4>Aeon T3 Quantum Optics Facility</h4>
            
            This building is in the same situation as the perimiter monitoring system, so it got the same treatment. We buffed its action radius so it needs fewer clicks to scout the enemy base. Now it needs less initial energy to work, so it doesn't create the all-too-common "why isn't it working" question.
            
                <ul>
                <li><b>Price:</b> <strike>48000e 2575bt 250HP</strike> → 60000e 3750bt 2000HP

            <h4>Strategic missile launchers</h4>
            
            Nuke + nuke defence: Build rate and missile build time rebalanced. Unassisted, nukes and anti-nukes still build in the same amount of time. However, engineers are now more effective at assisting SMDs, and less effective at assisting SMLs. Building an anti-nuke will now be more feasible when scouting an already built, but unloaded, SML.

                </ul>
                
            <b>Strategic missile defense:</b>

                <li><b>Strategic missile projectile - anti-nuke missile:</b>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                </ul>

            <h4>T3 Artillery</h4>
            
            Prices and ranges unified, HP increased. One faction's artillery can no longer be built out of the range of another's. All T3 arty can now survive a single T3 arty shot from any faction.
            
                <ul>
                <p>Aeon had two T3 artillery buildings, but one is rarely used. The Salvation has been reworked to have T3 arty stats, but retains its unique firing cycle. Aeon T3 arty is now better against armies and slightly worse against bases. 
                <p>The Emissary has been reworked to an expensive T4 Game Ender. At around half its (usually overkill) range and boasting even more dps, the Emissary is now comparable to a Mavor. While the Mavor has a higher alpha strike and a more swiftly moving round, the Emissary makes use of the damage over time mechanic which causes shields to have a hard time recovering. 
                
                <li>72 000m 1080000e 45000bt 150-700r (for all)

                </ul>
               
            <h4>Novax</h4>
            
            The Novax was almost in the right place, it just needed a nudge to make it nicer to use. Since it is a spy satellite and the UEF doesn't have a dedicated advanced intel structure, it got a slight intel boost. Removed the exploit of ctrl-k'ing Novaxes in midair to destroy SMDs, T3 artillery, and other expensive targets with no counterplay.
            
                <ul><b>Price:</b> <strike>28000m 400000e 25000bt</strike> → 30000m 450000e 18750bt

                </ul>

            
            <h4>Game Enders</h4>
            
            Gamenders had their resource prices adjusted. All game enders are now a tiny cheaper, they are more late game than usual due to eco adjustments.
