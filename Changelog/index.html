			<h1>Equilibrium Balance Mod Changelog</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the changelog for the Equilibrium balance mod. The purpose of this mod is to fix the existing issues with the game, and make improvements to gameplay by increasing its strategic diversity, while keeping the overall feel of the game the same and familiar, <b>so you don't need to relearn the game to play this mod.</b>

			<p>You don't need to read the whole changelog to be able to play, you can do exactly what you always do and it will work. Perhaps some of the things are not so strong as before but you can still pick all the usual strategies and be successful with them.

			<p>I put a lot of time and effort to bring you this mod, I hope you enjoy it as much as everyone else who has played it so far. 
            
            <p> To make things as easy as possible for you, I have split unit stat changes and the reasons for them into separate sections which you can jump to. The stat changes are followed by the explanations in a separate list. Where appropriate, I have included video links so you can get a better understanding of that mechanic/change.

			<p>If you have any feedback, suggestions or complaints I will be happy to listen to you. However please back up your opinions of balance with replay evidence first.

			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/c/cf/Upgrade_Icon.png">Veterancy</h3>
			This is the first major change of the mod, which overhauls the veterancy system and also allows it to become a larger part of the game rather than being mostly irrelevant for everything except T4 units and ACUs.
			<h4>Purpose</h4>
			
			Rewarding killing expensive (and therefore high hp and powerfully-armed) units. A T3 scout worth 195m should not award the same veterency as destroying a T3 battleship worth 9000m. <br />
			To make veterancy a system which is intuitive and predictable for each unit. Units need to destroy 150% of their own mass to vet up. <br />
			Removing the unintuitive requirement of self destructing lower tech units to prevent the enemy from gaining ridiculous amounts of experience. <br />
			Filling new max HP faster and making units with veterancy more important overall. T3 and T4 units have less HP gains to increase the viability of using lower tech units against higher tech ones. Experimentals vet up faster but don't gain as much from doing so. <br />
			Splitting veterancy rewards. Your units should gain xp relatively evenly, rather than have one level 5 Loyalist after an exp battle. <br />
			A rebalance of regeneration rates. Regen helps different units gain the most from veterancy values. Raiding units which won't live long get regen faster than units which do, but max out at lower overall regen values, helping to highlight their roles and making the game more varied. <br />
			Naval units and submarines are far more expensive than land units and have far more HP, so they also gain more regeneration. <br />
			
			<p> Here are the rules the new veterancy system:
			<ul>
      <li>Units no longer gain veterency levels from a flat number of kills. 
			<li>Units now receive veterancy points that are equal to the destroyed unit's mass cost. Units are promoted to next veterancy level when they have 150% of their own mass cost in veterancy points
      <li>ACUs and Experimentals are an exception to this rule; due to their high cost, they require only 50% of their mass value in veterency points to gain a star of veterency. 
			<li>ACUs will still not be able to be built (without mods), but for the purpose of veterency, their mass cost is 2000. 1000m is required for each level of veterency. This corresponds to around 20 T1 Tanks.
			<li>Destroying a unit with veterancy gives 20% more veterancy points per veterancy level of the destroyed unit. For example, killing a tank with 1 veterency level gives 120% of its mass cost in veterency to the attacking unit(s); killing a tank with 5 veterency levels awards 200% of its mass cost.
			<li>Multiple units killing the same target will split the veterency points between all units involved, in proportion to the damage dealt by each unit. A unit that deals 75% of the damage of a kill will be awarded 75% of that unit's mass in veterency points. <a href="http://recordit.co/t3kGOiPqcq">What that looks like.<a/>
			<p>
			<li>Promoted units receive new max health and gain higher regeneration, but  <a href="http://recordit.co/Y61oe1SANB"> no longer get any insta-heal<a/>. 
			<ul><li>T1/T2/SACU units gain 20% more max HP. <br />
			<li>T3/ACU units gain 15% more max HP. <br />
			<li>Experimentals gain 10% more max HP. </ul>
			<p>
			<li>Regen values for units have been normalized and split into two categories. Main Combat Units recieve less regen at lower levels, but their regen amounts scale up harder at higher veterency levels. Raider and Support units recieve a flat amount of regen each level.

		<div id="reclaim" class="card">
			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/f/f5/Cybran_T1_Engineer.png"> Reclaim</h3>
			<h4>Purpose</h4>
      
			Large reclaim fields provide something dynamic to fight over and adds variance to each game, but too often, entire fields are being reclaimed by one side before retaliation can be mounted by the other. Reclaim fields will last longer on the battlefield, requiring that you hold the field, rather than just dropping mass engineers. <br />
			SACU spam is an egregious example of this; not only are they strong in their own right, but if one dies, it could be reclaimed very quickly by the other SACUs near it and funneled into even more SACUs. SACU wrecks will now take additional time to reclaim on top of the increase to all wrecks.<br />
      Following the goal of keeping wreck fields on the battlefield longer, the Megalith has had its reclaim speed from building an egg on top of wrecks severly nerfed in order to keep it from nearly instantly reclaiming Experimental wrecks.  <br />
      In vanilla, a late-game air battle over the enemy's territory was a glorified mass donation. This led to long, drawn out games where a player with an economic or production advantage cannot leverage that advantage without an overwhelming lead. The FAF balance mod changed ASF wrecks to leave behind half the normal amount of mass in their wrecks; this is now being applied to Air Experimentals as well, to give players more freedom to use them over enemy territory. <br />
            
			<ul>			
			<li>The time needed to reclaim wrecks is now twice as long. A unit with a build rate of 1 now reclaims at <strike>10m/s</strike> → 5m/s 
			<li>SACU wrecks now take twice as long as other wrecks to reclaim, taking four times as long to reclaim as the old FAF values. 
      <li>Megalith reclaim speed -  <strike>1800m/s</strike> → 200m/s 
      <li>Air experimental unit wrecks contain - <strike>81% </strike> → 40.5% of original unit mass 
      </ul>

		<div id="factories" class="card">
			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/7/77/Cybran_T1_Land_Factory.png">Factories</h3>
			<h4>Purpose</h4>
			Unit and Factory stats have been normalized to drain a constant amount of resources, so now it's much easier to predict how many factories you can support on X amount of eco. <br />
			Reduction of the amount of engineers one is required to have throughout the game. Support factories are built more quickly and are cheaper, and can support more aggressive gameplay. This speeds up the game slightly, and lets you put out a strong spam of any tech level if you commit to it. <br />
			Made experimentals slower to build overall. Experimentals should not be able to be built in the same amount of time as a few T3 tanks. <br />
			Factory HP values were changed to be easier to snipe, encouraging thoughtful placement and shielding. <br /><br />
      
			Unassisted factories of the same tech level now drain resources at the same rate regardless of what is being build. A higher tech factory building lower tech units drains at the same speed, but builds units faster.
			<ul>
      <li>Factory Build Rates - T1 - T2 - T3
      <li>Land: <strike>20/40/90</strike> → 25/50/100

			<li>Navy: <strike>20/60/120</strike> → 20/60/180

			<li> Navy - 5m/50e - 15m/100e - 45m/450e
			</ul>
      Building/upgrading a factory has the same drain rate as building units inside the upgraded factory

			</ul>
			<ul>
            <li>T2/T3 support factories are built 3 times faster than HQs when upgraded from an existing factory.
            <li>In FAF, factories change their price depending on if you upgrade them or build with a higher tech engy. In equilibrium, the prices are tuned towards upgrading from existing factories, so building with engies may not give consistent drain values.
            <li>The dynamic price function was not fully working in FAF. It's been fixed in equilibrium; now the build time is also included in the dynamic price adjustment, so building with an engy is now displayed at the correct speed.

			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/4/48/Cybran_T2_Engineering_Station_L3.png"> Build Power</h3>
	
    <h4>Purpose:</h4>
			Making buildpower easier to estimate. Nerfed the build rates on Aeon and Seraphim T3 engineers to bring them in line with the other two races, buffed engineering stations, and normalized all engineer costs to correspond to new factory build and drain rates.<br />
			SACU default build rates decreased to help separate combat presets from eco and field engineer ones. This will create a real choice when deciding which to build.<br />
			Making the sacrifice system useful. Since engineers cost 5x more energy than mass, and most buildings cost 15x more energy than mass, engineers waste more mass than usual since the mass/energy ratio is different. Sacrifice ratios have been adjusted to waste a much smaller amount of resources.<br /><br />

			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/2/2a/Cybran_T2_Mass_Extractor.png"> Economy</h3>
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			Making energy storages more important, to separate the good players from the excellent ones.<br/>
			Making turtling and ecoing more risky, rewarding aggressive gameplay, bring a fairer choice between using factory or storage adjacency, and nerfing the T3 mex so when it’s next to 4 storages it dies to one TML and leaves 100% of its wreck value. Adjacency bonus decreased so players don't feel they have to put storages next to mexes, but still can.  HP and price decreased to make the storage better for storage purposes, not just eco.<br/><br/>
			Making mass fabricators a more viable option. Their efficiency is the same, but they live longer, and need less power to support them. With storages they have similar efficiency to T3 mexes without storages.<br/>
			Changed adjacency values for energy storage so that it's efficient to build it for economic reasons, not just for overcharging. 
			RAS is, quite frankly, OP. There is never a time where you don't want it, or a time where you would ever build a T3 pgen before getting RAS. RAS has been nerfed to increase the value of pgens, which opens up more strategic choices and new ways to attack your opponent. 
      
			<ul>
			<li>Mex Changes:
			<li>T2 mexes cost less mass to get players faster onto T2 eco, where the game becomes more interesting.
			<li>T3 mexes that are cheaper, but less effective especially with combination with less effective storages, this is a nerf to T3 eco, to smoothen the transition between T2/3 mexes.

			</ul>
 			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>To make the ACU eventually repairable and work correctly with the new veterancy system.
			<li>To nerf gun to keep it in line with the other changes and keep ranges consistent throughout the mod.
                <ul>
                <li>The turret turn rate helps with microing the acu when it switches targets - makes it nicer to use.
                </ul>
			<li>To make T2/3 units stronger against ACUs
			<li>To make Cybran acu more consistent with the others
			<li>Making T2 more useful for building, and less for fighting, for fighting there is a different upgrade, Aeon and Cybran have more because they can't have range/gun + T2, 
			<li>Price changed for to give a constant drain of 10m/s 200e/s, less HP for reason that HP gain from veteracy multiply and then cause problem with Seraphim nano that will survive nuke. 
			<li>Drains 20m/500e, making it much easier to get without ruining eco or pausing.
			<li>More consistent drain values when upgrading
			<li>Making it harder to kill an enemy ACUs at close ranges with ACU TML, acu tml doesn't destroy tmd
			<li>Aeon upgrades: 
				<ul>
				<li>Chrono: lowered price and effectiveness, making it a safer, more consistent upgrade, hoping that it will be seen more in game, because it’s an interesting option that is underused. 
				</ul>
			<li>UEF upgrades:
				<ul>
				<li>Nano: for more survivability
				<li>Shield: compared to Aeon, it costs less mass but more energy
				<li>Billy: making it a more consistent weapon, where it's easier to defend against, but it's more dangerous against land units
				</ul>
			
			<li>Cybran upgrades:
				<ul>
				<li>Gun: Because the acu lacks HP when compared to other factions
				<li>Laser: For more fluent numbers
				<li>Torpedo upgrade: To nerf Cybran early T2 navy where it's hard to counter torp acu
				<li>Cloak: making it cheaper so it can be used more often, because it’s an interesting part of the game
				</ul>
			
			<li>Seraphim upgrades:
				<ul>
				<li>Regen field: It's hard to compare to gun, so now its a choice between having a stronger acu, or a stronger army. more HP and regen to allow the acu to stay in fights longer. Reducing max regeneration on advanced restoration field is for a reason: to prevent abuse. BTW: did you know that a single full vet Seraphim destroyer (surfaced) with an ACU with resto field can quite easily beat a battleship? 
				<li>Heavy gun: To make it used more often in game, because it’s too expensive for normal use.
				</ul>

		<h2>Land</h2>
		
        In this mod land units are adjusted to keep the same purposes but to make gameplay more consistent (less random BS) and make tech level progression not so steep - so you can use lower tech units more effectively later on, rather than having to crtl-k them for mass.
            
            <ul>
			<li>T1 units have more HP, and less dps, in total with the same efficiency, but give more time while they are being killed = can be used as a meat shield for higher tech armies that have a larger range
			<li>T2 units have more concentrated dps in one unit, and have units with special roles
			<li>T3 units have even more concentrated dps and HP in one unit than T2, and have additional units for special roles.
			<li>T4 experimentals have a new build-time, which is 33% of their mass spent on units built from a T3 factory, before was experimental build-time was equal to ~12%.
			</ul>

			</ul>
			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>Making labs usable not only at the start of the game, more speed to be better for raiding; they have had a huge buff, but don’t worry they still lose to tanks in direct combat in larger numbers! However you can now use them with a T1/2 army as well.
				<ul>
				<li>Changed target priorities to something more logical: where you kill radar first, and then ACU for easier ghetto snipes.
				<li>Selen: more maneuverability to be more like a lab and less like a scout and easier way how to use him invisible intel feature where remove repetitive clicking.
				<li>Flare: Capture for possible capture mex instead of destroying. So you can use labs for things other than just raiding for the first 5 minutes. 
				<li>Mech marine: strongest lab, but without any abilities.
				</ul>
			<li>To be able to chase bombers better, survive single bomb and be worth building in the first place, now it can also hit interceptors. 
				<ul>
				<li>The Cybran MAA is also usable like a weaker aurora, with the same range. Homing projectile, because look awesome and whiteout it miss most of shot on long range. Have more AA range because other AA are faster.
				<li>To make it easier to use since you don't need to remember which units are toggled, they auto toggle now.
                <li>This is a fun feature, like mantis repair. It's nearly useless but maybe it can have a creative use sometimes. Their range is reduced in transports so they don't outrange interceptors, and can't kite them.
				</ul>
			<li>T1 Mobile artillery: mostly unchanged, but it needed some adjustments to fit in with the balance and got some quality-of-life changes.
				<ul>
				<li>Medusa: Stun added against T3 units, dps added to make it less annoying to use vs pd, so price is also increased.
				<li>Fervor: Compensating for the aurora losing range, their main advantage on T1, the fervor was made better for use against land units (and acu). 
				<li>Lobo: vision time increased for constant visibility while firing. and give this feature more potential. AOE increased to help it compete with other artillery.
				</ul>
			<li>T1 now tanks live longer, so take a longer time to defend against push. Also can be a better meat shield for higher tech units, so they are more useful in late game.
				<ul>
				<li>Speed decreased to let LABs have more room for raiding.
				<li>Mantis now have a tank icon so you can separate them from labs, which are now usable in your main army. More build rate so the assist feature is used more often, less dps, but better damage per shot. It’s mainly a nerf for Cybran, where they have additional damage from MAA, basically for free now.

			<li>To have consistent and predictable drain values. Deceiver remove this ability to nerf cybran OPnes, while mobile shield also didn't work in transport. 
			<li>AA flak: To make gunships a more useful option, the hover ability is now more expensive. Faction with t2 shield have less HP on flak. Target priority changed to reduce annoying behavior, less range, and more <a href="http://recordit.co/VfcGiVdhbU"> muzzle velocity<a/>  to make them be more reliable.
			<li>MML: Tweak it a bit for make deeper faction diversity
                <ul>
                <li>Seraphim: This factions trait is to have fewer, more versatile, multifunctional units, such as their T2 destroyers taking on the role of T2 submarines. Their T2 land is not very diverse. This change makes MML also usable against land units on a shorter range, making it follow the factional design philosophy.

                <li>Aeon: Big reload time, is huge disadvantage against tmd, projectile are faster what will help and with more aoe also can do some damage to army. 
                <li>UEF: Camera on UEF T1 artillery is a nice feature, so now its on the MML as well, so you can use it to tell what you are shooting at - complementing the turtle-war specialised faction.

                    </ul> 
                </ul>
			<li>Hover units are better on land, but worse against navy, so they are now a relevant strategic option on land and while not as OP on navy.
			<li>Hoplite slowed down, because hover units are also slower, and they need to be able to catch hoplites.
			<li>Sparky is now a stronger unit that can compete better during the T3 stage, in exchange for a price increase.
			<li>Mongeese don’t miss, making them a very deadly unit, so I decided on a conceptual change to a new unit type, which is in between hoplites and pillars. It adds a  new strategic option that is different than simply using hoplites, and increases faction diversity.
			<li>Rhino turret turn rate increased to make them more consistent when being microed.
			<li>Riptide is made useable on land, has more build time so its harder to spam, what make them less effective against navy.
			<li>Obsidians with their changed target priority are now less vulnerable to OC, because you can now spread them and still focus the ACU.
			<li>Ilshavoh loosen restrictions on its guns so it can shoot closer to itself.
            <li>Fire beetles are more effective against land armies and worse for sniping ACUs, their cloak can be combined with deceivers for a potentially deadly weapon. Use with cloaked moles to confuse the enemy!

			What I tried to achieve with T3 balance is to have a T3 tech which doesn't make T2 units obsolete, but does give an advantage. Currently T1/2 units very quickly become useless as soon as the T3 level is reached, which I think is quite sad since T2 has all the support units that should be used with t3, instead of just brick spam.

            Experimentals in this game were not in the right spot - they were more of a cheese unit than a true experimental. Their incredibly fast build time leads to teams rushing a monkey and the difference between a victory and a mass donation relying on whether the opponent scouts you 10 seconds later, which is not a consistent way of winning the game. Because of this the experimentals are very weak in direct, fair combat. I increased their buildtime and make them less cheese and more strategic instead.
            
            <p>
			Experimentals have roughly 15% less HP than before
            <p>

			<li>Megalith egg build times adjusted to the Megalith’s new build rate and units are built 2x faster than in a regular T3 factory.
			</ul>
            
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>T3 units are weaker in this mod (-25%dps -35%HP), so experimentals are changed to maintain balance.
			<li>Price increased because Ion storm is now extremely useful for supporting your army.
			<li>DPS moved  from long range to short, because T3 units have less HP, and dps, short range is less annoying and gives more time for opponents to deal with the fatboy.
			<li>Scathis was a very cheap game ender on small maps, and useless on larger ones. 
				<ul>
				<li>Reworked as a mobile artillery piece, with more versatility but far less destructive power.
				<li>EMP is for supporting allied armies, and to disrupt the enemy.
                <li>It can now mover faster, but is slow to accelearate, like a train.
                <li>It is now able to support navies by firing from underwater - this is only usefull on mostly water maps since on land you can have it shielded, and it is vulnerable to torpedo bombers.
				</ul>
            <li>Megalith adjust flak for same number as have t2 mobile flak.

            Previously OP, the SACUs have received a much needed rebalance in this mod. Here extra care was taken to ensure that all the presets can be used in various situations, and even SACUs without presets. In general SACUs have a more supporting role and work well when mixed in with T3 units.

			</ul>
			
			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>Price and range reduced to make SACUs weaker without any upgrades, but worth building like presets, opening a new role for SACUs. 
			<li>With reduced buildpower and more time to be reclaimed SACU there is less chance that SACU spam will reclaim anything that dies immediately after the battle.
			<li>The death explosions make SACU spam more risky since it could start a chain reaction, also it’s possible to use as a kamikaze weapon. Damage type changed to prevent teleportation snipes of important buildings by dieing next to them. 
			
			<li>Aeon:
            <ul>
			<li>Sacrifice removed: because it was a useless upgrade, and it’s much better to have nano in it’s place so you have a military upgrade on each slot. Now sacrifice is part of the rapid fabricator.
			</ul>
			
			<li>UEF:
            <ul>
			<li>Jamming is cheaper, because it’s not used often and it buffs pure support SACUs. 
			<li>Gun: nerfed because it was OP.
			<li>Bubble shields are cheaper and  have better regeneration to increase the use of pure support SACUs.
			</ul>
			
			<li>Cybran:
            <ul>
			<li>Lots of HP and lack of dps: to increase faction diversity, and for AA/EMP that will be stronger without any extra upgrades.
			<li>Stealth: changed to a stealth field, to encourage use as a support SACU.
			<li>EMP: Stun changed to be less op against T3 units.
			<li>Nano: regeneration decreased because T3 units have less dps.
			<li>Cloak: buffed so it's used more often.
			</ul>
			
			<li>Seraphim:
            <ul>
			<li>Decreased passive resource generation to make them like the other factions, it was a big buff, and Seraphim SACUs are already the best fighters so they don’t need another advantage for free. 
			<li>Swapped the positions of the rapid fabricator with teleport so you can have combat engineer SACUs.
			<li>TML is more expensive but has more aoe, and more importantly can store up to 3 missiles which can annihilate an incoming army from huge ranges.
			<li>Overchange: less dps and rof so it's not as OP, more aoe so it's better against units when it fires, range bonus so you don't need to have sensor upgrade for it to be effective, because the default range is 23.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>To re-enable the fuel mechanic which is currently non-existent and to give air staging facilities and carriers a purpose again, leading in general to more selective and locational use of air, rather than just denying all air after 1 fight.
            <li>Airstaging was needed at T1, and was priced like a T1 building, so it was moved there for convenience.
            <li>The free repair prevents them from seizing up when you are stalling, and effectively trapping your aircraft in them.

			</ol>
			
			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Price changed to standardise the factory drain values and to help promote scouting.
            <li>Less energy cost and more mass cost to make tech switching is easier and to encourage each player in a team game to build some air. The speed increase helps catch strats.
            <li>Buffed bombers, to make them easier to use, since they make the game more interesting and to keep them in line since MAA is buffed in this mod. There is now much less reason to hoverbomb since they bombers have a much improved turning circle.
                <ul>
                <li>Removed friendly fire to avoid situations where multiple bombers kill themselves with their own bombs.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                <li>Aeon: Increasing faction diversity, the Aeon bomber is better for single targets, and higher tech units; the emp can also support your army, but it’s less useful for armies, unlike Seraphim with its large aoe.
                </ul>
            <li>First jester is not an issue, so it can be of a similar mass efficiency to T2 gunships, also the buff helps maintain its effectiveness since T1/2 MAA has been buffed here.
            <li>Transports are underused and make the gameplay more dynamic and interesting, so I tried to encourage transport usage. Speed increased since interceptors have more speed, and they can drop into more dangerous territory now.
                <ul>
                <li>Aeon transport capture ability for more faction diversity, and add a potentially interesting tool and new tactics, such as abducting enemy engineers and helping out during island drops.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>Increased the faction diversity with gunships:
                <ul>
                <li>Spectres are faster because Aeon doesn't have a T2 bomber,
                <li>Renegades have  more range because they can't move while firing effectively
                <li>Vulthoos are stronger because Seraphim doesn't have T3 gunships 
                </ul>
			<li>Torpedo Bombers are slightly better with a bit more speed and turn rate. They were given depth charges to make the more consistent, also cleaning up buggy code in the process.
			<li>T2 air needed to be better against T3 air, so T2fighter/bombers cost less, have less ground damage and health, but AA dps is unchanged. Also the Notha firing tolerance changed so it doesn't miss as much. 
                <ul>
                <li>Target priorities to make using them less frustrating
                <li>Corsair AA was buffed to be more similar to other T2 bombers (still much worse)
                <li>Swift winds receive more HP to maintain their advantage as the best T2 AA fighter.
                </ul>
			<li>Mercies have been reworked to be better against sniping buildings, and worse for ACU snipes - an ACU moving away will receive only ~30% of the full damage. Crash damage was increased so that the mercy is only 99% useless if it gets shot down and because it makes more sense for a flying bomb to deal some damage on falling.
			<li>Transports got some regeneration to make them reusable without needing to pay attention to repair them, more speed because interceptors are also faster.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            
            <ol>
			<li>Increased faction diversity between Spy planes:
                <ul>
                <li>Cybran added stealth toggle, and energy consumption, so it's in line with the other stealthed aircraft.
                <li>Seraphim doesn’t have any advanced intel like the other factions ( eye of rihane, Soothsayer, novax) so you can place it in the enemy base similar to Selens.
                </ul>
            <li>ASF were just unbelievably OP. Their price was increased to allow more time for T2 units, before the inevitable ASF swarm arrives. They have less speed, more reload time, less dps to make them less superior (brutally unstoppable with air) and allow T2 air to compete (but still lose), more turret yaw/pitch range to give less random results in air combat (this is the cone where asf can fire). And even after such nerfs they are still superior.
            <li>T3 gunships are a very interesting but underused unit so they got cheaper, with the same effectiveness so you can build them more often (also buffed a bit).
                <ul>
                <li>Cybran got stealth instead of jamming so you can have fully stealthed T3 air, and because it’s a Cybran trait, allowing them to have a fully stealthed t3 air.
                <li>UEF got jamming because it’s more of a UEF trait.
                <li>Aeon restorer is adjusted slightly so it’s the same as before relative to changed air.
                </ul>
            <li>Continental: Less energy consumption and less AA dps  - better than making it stupidly expensive. Its shield bubble is also slightly bigger so it can be combined with T3 gunships and cover them.
            <li>Strats were a bit of a cheese unit so they have less speed and HP so they can be countered with T1/2 air, they got some damage tweaks to make them more consistent, more reload time so they doesn’t destroy mexes too well while hover bombing.
                <ul>
                <li>Cybran strat was nerfed with less survivability and more energy maintenance while stealth is huge advantage and now destroy T2 mex by single pass as others.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            

            <ol>
            <li>Wreck: Air experimentals dont live long in enemy territory and so need this change to be able to operate there while giving less of a mass donation. This is the same for ASF in normal FAF.
			<li>Soul Ripper: decreased its mass cost, because it's not much stronger than a GC -  when instant heal doesn't exist air exps are weaker (and are less cheese). More crash damage, because it's a very big unit.  
			<li>Ahwassa: speed reduced so it's easier to catch up to. Also its range was reduced a little so its not so easy to abuse its hover bombing ability to out-range SAMs. Like other air exps, it got a boost to its AA dps, but we were careful not to make it OP, so it has reduced range because of that.
			<li>CZAR: It was a useless unit, that could help only due to its massive crash damage. But the CZAR is an experimental fortress, not a mercy. Massive increases to its HP and AA effectiveness help it be at least a little useful against air, and less against land. Now a CZAR can destroy 50-75% of its own mass in asf. The beam damage was changed to be more effective against buildings, and less against moving land units, and depth charge dps was increased so that they’re not absolutely useless. The CZARs speed was reduced to make it less about cheese and more about strategy, and also helping ground AA counter it (20-25% mass in land AA destroys a CZAR)

			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/b/b5/Cybran_T2_Sub_Hunter.png">General changes</h3>
            
            Navy had the best tech level balance in FAF, but there are still some small things which could be ironed out. Several non-naval units were also introduced to the naval game to make it more refreshing and diverse, such as mobile shields.
            <p>
            Submarines in the naval game are a little underused, and things have been shifted around to make them more useful and interesting. I made every unit useful even on the T3 stage, by using a very old balance model all the way from GPG pre-beta, then making it all work with the help of torpedo defenses.
            <p>
            As a whole, surface warfare is largely unchanged, but submarines and other support units should be seen more often.
            
            <ul>
            <li>All T1 attack submarines are now effective against surface ships. Getting mass T1 sub spam can work all the way into the late T3 stage, but expect to be countered.
            <li>T2 Sub Hunters now actually have the role of hunting subs. They have very low HP and very strong torpedo defense for this purpose, and can kite T1 subs
            <li>Surface ships already have high HP and are now equiped with depth charges, which bypass the sub hunters' torpedo defenses and easily kill them.
            <li>To prevent "great submarine micro" where you stack them all in one spot to increase torpedo defense effectiveness, all torpedoes and depth charges have 0.5AOE. Don't stack your submarines. Just don't.
            <li>All torpedo/depth charge weapons have new target priorities which focus subhunters first. This is because they have their torp defense and the least HP and so are optimal targets.
            <li>As always, Seraphim being the faction with no units, they are special and have a T1 submarine which is better against subhunters. Their destroyer now has a reason to be submerged; it acts like an attack submarine.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>Frigates are now a powerful intel unit. Other ships rely on them for intel rather than just HP sinks.
                <ul>
                <li>AA nerfed on the Trident Class. The Cybrans have a very solid cruiser and T2 submarines they dont need op frigates anymore.
                <li>The Shard now has more HP, so it doesn't get killed in one pass by torpedo bombers. It also has torpedo defense to help against submarines.
                <li>The Beacon has more range than others but less speed, micro will make it more effective than other frigates.
                </ul>
            <li>T1 Attack submarines get their originally intended role. Their job is to sink ships. And they got some serious buffs to enable that.
                <ul>
                <li>The deck gun range was reduced because it outranged frigates which would have made submarines very strong early game for raiding mexes.
                <li>The Aeon submarine is faster because it doesn’t have a deck gun, which can be a huge disadvantage.
                <li>The Seraphim submarine is different as usual. It has less HP but torpedo defense to cover up for it. This defense is very strong in large numbers.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>Sub hunters: They were given their original pre-beta role. Now they really do hunt submarines, due to their extremely powerful torpedo defense, with which they can protect a whole fleet.
                <ul>
                <li>Cooper: Nerfed a little so it's not better against destroyers than a destroyer (when microed).
                </ul>
			<li>Mermaid: These boats provide a huge stealth advantage. The price increase should balance that and the crazy anti-torp stacking they have. Regen added because it can't get veterancy.
			<li>Bulwark: Price changed to standardise factory drain values. Regen added because it can’t get veterancy. Lower range on its shield so you need more bulwarks to completely cover your navy. (its one of the main reasons why UEF navy is OP)
			<li>Cruisers got their price changed to standardise factory drain values.
                <ul>
                <li>Infinity Class: Tiny buff to its tiny ground weapon to help make it more convenient by making it stay further behind due to its larger range.
                <li>Siren Class: Since cybrans don't have shields, their cruiser gets more HP to survive longer vs torps. With more HP, and less dps it will buy more time for the rest of the cybran navy to deal damage, due to the decentralised nature of their AA dps. Since it's also better in surface warfare you can build these more often into your navy, but they are completely defenseless vs submerged threats.
                    <ul>
                    <li>Toggle on its AA removed to fix a poorly implemented function where players can't tell if it's set to engage air or land. Now it will manage itself.
                    </ul>
                <li>The seraphim cruiser got a quality of life change to its flak weapon - more muzzle velocity, less dps to make it more consistent.
                </ul>
            <li>Destroyers got their water vision reduced as part of the submarine rework. They now have more aoe and muzzle velocity so they're able to hit small land units, which were nearly immune to destroyers. They now shoot depth charges which are great against subhunters but their low dps is not good against massed attack submarines. Faster depth-charges projectile to reduce overkill. They got a new strategic icon to help differentiate them from subs, since they're now a lot less anti-naval focused.
                <ul>
                <li>Exodus: aoe increased to fix the lack of a T2 land bombardment unit without messing up naval balance.

                <li>Strategic submarines are cheaper because they are underused and make the game more fun. Plan B reworked to increase faction diversity and to make it usable against navy, it’s not as good as Seraphim sub hunters, but it can compete.
                </ul>
            <li>Direct fire ships got a water vision adjustment to let support ship have stronger role on this field.
                <ul>
                <li>Neptune: Price increased to compensate for its power agaisnt T2 navy.
                <li>Torrent has more HP to bring its stats in line with T3 navy. Increased dps to be almost as good as the same mass in UEF/Seraphim cruisers. More build time to make it more like a T3 unit. It now also has a manual TML launcher that helps give it an edge over T2 Cruiser Bombardment.
                </ul>
            <li>Galaxy has more range so it’s less crap.
			<li>Summit dps and muzzle velocity reduced to make it more balanced against navy.
			<li>Atlantis is faster so it’s not a sea snail. Regen added because every T4 has natural regen. Both the Atlantis and Tempest got special seabed detection code so they don't clip through the floor as much anymore. Because of this in some cases they are more difficult to groundfire.
			<li>Tempest build time increased by a lot (4x), fixed so it's a real experimental - it still loses against equal mass in battleships or subs but now it has a reason to be built, aside from a stupidly fast build time.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>T3 Sonar costs more. It was stupidly cheap compared to naval units and intel structures.
			<li>T1 torpedo launchers are much better for killing early submarines. Their depth charges stop sub hunters.
			<li>T2 torpedo launchers get stealth so there is at least some reason to build them. Their HP was increased and they were given depth charged to handle everything that gets in their range.
			<li>The HARMS received a rework to its deployment - now it sinks to the sea floor and deploys there, with extra visual effects. It still fires torpedoes, so it's countered by subhunters, but everything else is in danger. Double mouth of torpedo and half dmg, to work better against torpedo defense.

            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
            <li>T1 PD: It was too strong against T1 tanks when compared to T2 PD.
			<li>T2 PD: Adjusted and standardized the prices and build times so they work with all the land changes.
			<li>T3 PD: Nerfed to maintain balance with the nerfed T3 units. 
			<li>T2 Static Artillery: This unit was nearly useless due to its firing randomness and cost, it was only worth building them against fatboys and in some cases Cybran T2 navy. In this mod they are reworked to be a T2 version of T3 artillery. Very expensive, but can be serious threat for the enemy base or an incoming army. A game ender on 5x5 1v1 maps and a major investment in teamgames. Faction diversity was also increased, where different factions have different artillery. 
			<li>TML: AOE increased to kill storage around mexes when targetting them. It is also better at hitting moving units now, to make using this against armies more viable. The amount of missiles TMLs can store has also been decreased, since you never need 20 and forgetting to disable autobuild will waste eco.
            <li>TMD: FAF balance broke it, we're unbreaking it.
                <ul>
                <li>The Aeon TMD has been (finally) fixed! It will now catch missiles flying over it. They are now the best TMD. However, they trade hp and range for this advantage.

			<li>T2 Flak: Muzzle velocity and AOE increased so flak is usable vs T3 air. Higher cost because of more expensive SAM and mobile flak.

            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Walls: We all know how good they are. Now they have half of their previous HP and are slower to reclaim.
            <li>Shields remain mostly the same, with just a couple of small changes here and there to keep with the new unit balance. A notable change is that the Cybran shield ED4 can now be built at T3, then upgraded once to the ED5 if needed.
            <li>Stealth: Seraphim personal cloak was added so that this building is fully invisible, except for a visual effect. This makes it easier to use offensively since the generator itself is harder to find. To prevent it from being used as a stealth intel system, its visual radius was reduced. It add more faction diversity to game.
            <li>T1/2 Radar: resource adjusted to fit equilibrium's building pattern where units of the same type and tech drain same resources while being built.
            <li>T3 Radar: On the most popular maps its enough to place one somewhere in your back base and its enough to see the whole map. We just made it require a little more strategic placement and use of (gasp) multiple radars on larger maps.
            <li>Perimeter Monitoring System: This is a very expensive and rarely used building, and needed more HP so its harder to snipe and the reclaim doesnt get damaged as much.
            <li>Quantum optics: It's in the same situation as the perimiter monitoring system, so it got the same treatment. We buffed its action radius so it needs fewer clicks to scout the enemy base. Now it needs less initial energy to work, so it doesn't create the all-too-common "why isn't it working" question.

                </ul>    
                

            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Nuke + nuke defence: Build rate and missile build time rebalanced. Unassisted, nukes and anti-nukes still build in the same amount of time. However,  engineers are now more effective at assisting SMDs, and less effective at assisting SMLs. Building an anti-nuke will now be more feasible when scouting an already built, but unloaded, SML. 
            <li>T3 artillery: Prices and ranges unified, HP increased. One faction's artillery can no longer be built out of the range of another's. All T3 arty can now survive a single T3 arty shot from any faction.
            <ul>
                <li>Aeon had two T3 artillery, but one was never used. The Salvation has been reworked to have T3 arty stats, but retains its unique firing cycle. Aeon T3 arty is now better against armies and slightly worse against bases. 
                <li>The Emissary has been reworked to an expensive T4 Game Ender. At around half its (usually overkill) range and boasting even more dps, the Emissary is now comparable to a Mavor. While the Mavor has a higher alpha strike and a more swiftly moving round, the Emissary makes use of the damage over time mechanic which causes shields to have a hard time recovering. 
            </ul>
            <li> Experimental Satellite: The Novax was almost in the right place, it just needed a nudge to make it nicer to use. Since it is a spy satellite and the UEF doesn't have a dedicated advanced intel structure, it got a slight intel boost. Removed ability of destroying SMDs, T3 artillery, and other expensive targets with no counterplay via ctrl-k'ing Novaxes in midair. 
            <li> Game enders: Adjusted resource prices. All game enders are now cheaper, to put them in line with the lowered late game eco. 
            </ol>
