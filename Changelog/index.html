			<h1>Equilibrium Balance Mod Changelog</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the changelog for the Equilibrium balance mod. The purpose of this mod is to fix the existing issues with the game, and make improvements to gameplay by increasing its strategic diversity, while keeping the overall feel of the game the same and familiar, <b>so you don't need to relearn the game to play this mod.</b>

			<p>You don't need to read the whole changelog to be able to play, you can do exactly what you always do and it will work. Perhaps some of the things are not so strong as before but you can still pick all the usual strategies and be successful with them.

			<p>I put a lot of time and effort to bring you this mod, I hope you enjoy it as much as everyone else who has played it so far. 
            
            <p> To make things as easy as possible for you, I have split unit stat changes and the reasons for them into separate sections which you can jump to. The stat changes are followed by the explanations in a separate list. Where appropriate, I have included video links so you can get a better understanding of that mechanic/change.

			<p>If you have any feedback, suggestions or complaints I will be happy to listen to you. However please back up your opinions of balance with replay evidence first.

			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/f/ff/Cybran_Wall.png"> Quick Summary</h3>
			There are many changes in this mod, but don't worry, you need to remember only a few of them! The rest are designed to bring improvements while not compromising your gameplay.
			<ul>
			<li> Mercies deal damage over time! Moving targets receive only a fraction of the damage.
			<li> Submarine warfare: Subs now counter suface ships; Sub Hunters counter subs and destroyers counter sub hunters!
            <li> Mass storages provide less adjacency and any mass stored in them is lost when they are destroyed.
			<li> RAS energy income has been nerfed, don't reclaim your pgens afterwards!
			<li> T4 units take much longer to build. Get t2/3 engineers, they are more efficient in this mod.
			<li> Veterancy doesn't instant-heal units anymore, don't rely on that when attacking with experimentals or your ACU.
			</ul>

			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/c/cf/Upgrade_Icon.png">Veterancy</h3>
			This is the first major change of the mod, which fixes many issues with veterancy and also allows it to become a larger part of the game rather than being mostly irrelevant for everything except T4 units and ACUs.
			<p> Here are the rules the new veterancy system as follows:
			<ul>
			<li>Units receive veterancy points that are equal to the destroyed unit's mass cost.
			<li>Units are promoted to next veterancy level, when they have 150% of their own mass cost in veterancy points
			<li>Destroying a unit with veterancy gives 20% more veterancy for each level - killing a tank with 1 star: 120% of its mass cost, killing a tank with 5 stars: 200% of its mass cost is awarded.
			<li>If multiple units kill the same target, the veterancy is shared out between them according to the fraction of the damage they dealt.
            <li> <a href="http://recordit.co/t3kGOiPqcq">What it looks like<a/>
			<p>
			<li>After promotion units receive new max health and gain higher regeneration, but  <a href="http://recordit.co/Y61oe1SANB"> don't get any insta-heal<a/>.
			<li>T1/T2/sACU units gain 20% more max HP.
			<li>T3/ACU units gain 15% more max HP.
			<li>Experimentals gain 10% more max HP.
			<p>
			<li>All units gain increased regeneration depending on which category they are in:
			<li>Main Combat Units → The regen they get increases with each level
			<li>Raider/Support Units → The rise in regen is linear.
			</ul>
			<p>
			<p>
			Regeneration values for Main Combat Units:
			<ul>
			<li> T1: +0.5+1+1.5+2+2.5 => 0.5/1.5/3/5/7.5
			<li> T2: +1+2+3+4+5 => 1/3/6/10/15
			<li> T3: +1.5+3+4.5+6+7.5 => 1.5/4.5/9/15/22.5
			<li> SACUs: +2+4+6+8+10 => 2/6/12/20/30
			<li> T4: +6+12+18+24+30 => 6/18/36/60/90
			<p>
			<li> ACU (Special Case): 5+5+5+5+5 =>(10+) 5/10/15/20/25
			</ul>
			<p>
			Raider/Support Units:
			<ul>
			<li> T1:+1+1+1+1+1 => 1/2/3/4/5
			<li> T2:+2+2+2+2+2 => 2/4/6/8/10
			<li> T3:+3+3+3+3+3 => 3/6/9/12/15
			</ul>
			<p>
			Ships (Main Combat):
			<ul>
			<li> T1: +1+2+3+4+5 => 1/3/6/10/15
			<li> T2: +2+4+6+8+10 => 2/6/12/20/30
			<li> T3: +6+12+18+24+30 => 6/18/36/60/90
			</ul>
			<p>
			Submarines (Raider/Support):
			<ul>
			<li> T1: +2+2+2+2+2 => 2/4/6/8/10
			<li> T2: +3+3+3+3+3 => 3/6/9/12/15
			<li> T3: +6+6+6+6+6 => 6/12/18/24/30
			</ul>
			<p>
			
			Main Combat Units are: Buildings, T1/2/3 tanks(not fast), Artillery, Mobile AA, AA air, T2F/B, Gunships, Ships
			<p>
			Raider units are: Land scouts, LABs, T2 hover tanks, T2 range bots, T3 raid bots, T3 snipers, Bombers, Transports, Submarines
			<p>
			ACUs/Experimentals only need to destroy 50% of their own cost in mass worth of enemy units.
			<p>
			ACUs mass cost 2000m => 1000m required for vet = ~20T1 units to get veterancy but for destroying an ACU units gain 2000xp
			
			<h4>Purpose</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>To avoid situations when destroying a T3 scout (195m) is worth the same as destroying a T3 battleship (9000m)
			<li>To add a system which is fair and predictable for each unit (units need to destroy 100% of their own mass to vet up)
			<li>You should no longer be required to self destruct lower tech units to prevent the enemy from gaining ridiculous amounts of experience
			<li>To fill new max HP faster and make units with veterancy more important overall. T3/4 units have less HP gains to promote using lower tech units against higher tech ones. Experimentals vet up faster but don't gain as much from doing so.
			<li>Splitting veterancy rewards ensures that units gain vet much more evenly rather than having one 5 vet loyalist after an exp battle.
			<li>The regeneration helps different units gain the most from veterancy values - units which won't live long get regen faster than units which do, helping to highlight their roles and making them more varied.
			<li>Naval units and submarines are far more expensive than land units and have more HP so they also gain more regeneration.  
			</ul>

		<div id="reclaim" class="card">
			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/f/f5/Cybran_T1_Engineer.png"> Reclaim</h3>
			1. The time needed to reclaim something is 2x longer.
			<ul>			
			<li> A unit with a build rate of 1 reclaims at: <strike>10m/s</strike> → 5m/s 
			</ul>
            <p>
			2. The sACU wreck is reclaimable 2x <a href="http://recordit.co/otLq64yEel"> slower than other units<a/>.
            <p>
            3. <a href="http://recordit.co/o3n6d4imXh"> Megalith’s egg reclaim abuse<a/> is now minimized: <strike>1800m/s</strike> → 200m/s 
            <p>
            4. Air experimental unit wrecks contain: <strike>81% mass</strike> → 40.5% mass 
			<h4>Purpose</h4>
            <ol>
			<li>To make it harder to secure a reclaim field after a fight, meaning that the map becomes more dynamic as there are reclaim fields to fight over for longer.</ul>
			<li>Taking more time to be reclaimed, sACU spam will no longer instantly be converted into mass as soon as one of them dies.
            <li>To prevent situations where a megalith immediately reclaims experimentals from the battle field. 
            <li>Air experimentals leave half of their mass in wrecks now - this is because they are likely to die quickly and this decreases the amount of mass delivery. Its similar to the reason why FAF changed it on ASF - To have more freedom while using them on enemy territory.
            </ol>
            
		</div>
		
		<div id="factories" class="card">
			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/7/77/Cybran_T1_Land_Factory.png">Factories</h3>
			1.Units of the same tech level now <a href="http://recordit.co/PqqLBv9ALV"> drain resources<a/>  at similar rates, a higher tech factory building lower tech units drains the same amount, but builds units faster.
			<ul>
			<li>Factory type - 	T1 - 	T2 - 	T3
			<li>Land: 5m/25e - 10m/50e - 20m/200e
			<li> Air: 3m/50e - 7m/150e - 20m/1000e
			<li> Navy: 5m/50e - 15m/100e - 45m/450e
			</ul>
			2.Building/upgrading a factory has the same drain as building units inside the upgraded factory:
			<ul>
			<li>Factory type - 	T1 - 	T2 - 	T3
            <li>Land:<strike>240m 2100e 300bt - 800m 7200e 1600bt - 3400m  30600e 11000bt</strike> →
			<li>Land: 300m 1500e 300bt - 900m 4500e 2250bt - 3600m  36000e 9000bt
            <li>Air:<strike>210m 2400e 300bt - 640m 11700e 1600bt - 3250m  85091e 10400bt</strike> →
			<li>Air: 210m 3500e 350bt - 630m 13500e  1800bt  - 3600m 120000e 9600bt
            <li>Naval:<strike>300m 1500e 300bt - 1370m 6600e 1800bt - 5450m  24472e 9180bt</strike> →
			<li>Naval:300m 3000e 300bt  - 1350m 9000e 1800bt - 3600m 36000e 9000bt
			</ul>
			3.The same rule applies to slave factory upgrades:
			<ul>
            <li>T2/3 slave factories are built 3 times faster than HQs (when upgraded from an existing factory)
            <li>In FAF, factories change their price depending on if you upgrade them or build with a higher tech engy. In equilibrium, the prices are tuned towards upgrading from existing factories, so building with engies may not give consistent drain values.
            <li>Additionally, in FAF this dynamic price function was not fully working. It's fixed in equilibrium - now the build time is also included in the dynamic price adjustment, so building with an engy is now at the correct speed.
			</ul>
			
			4.Factory build rates:
			<ul>
			<li>Land: <strike>20/40/90</strike> → 25/50/100 
			<li>Air: <strike>20/40/120</strike> → 20/40/120 
			<li>Navy: <strike>20/60/120</strike> → 20/60/180 
			<li>Quantum gateway: <strike>120</strike> → 100
			</ul>
			
			5.Build time of experimentals:
			<ul>
			<li>T4 <b>land</b> units build <b>3</b> times faster than equivalent mass in a T3 factory
			<li>T4 <b>air</b> units build <b>4.8</b> times faster than equivalent mass in a T3 factory
			</ul>
			
			6.Factory HP:
            <p>
            
            <ul> T1 factory
            
                <ul><b>Land/Air:</b> T1 factory = T2 support factory

                </ul>
            </ul>
            
			<h4>Purpose</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>In equilibrium we basically took all the unit stats and cleaned them up, so now its much easier to predict how much eco you need to support X factories.
			<li>Slave factories are built faster, and are cheaper, so you need fewer engineers in game, and support more aggressive gameplay
			<li>This speeds up the game slightly, and lets you put out a strong spam of any tech level if you commit to it.
			<li>Engymod didnt take things quite far enough so we finished the job for them, and this change nerfs engineers slightly as a result.
			<li>Make experimentals slower to build, (and remove situations when a megalith is built in the same time as 3 bricks) Air is built faster than land because it's more expensive and needs to be built faster so they are still useable and convenient to build, without needing huge hordes of engies. 
			<li>Factory HP values were changed so its easier to snipe them, encouraging better placement and shielding. Also its easy to remember: Each HQ has double the HP of its predecessor, and support factories have 50% of their HQ. (Naval factories get 75%)

			<li>sACUs: <strike>90</strike> → 80% mass value and <strike>90</strike> → 80% energy value 
			</ul>
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>Making buildpower easier to estimate. And removing the imbalance where Aeon/Seraphim T3 engineers get more build power for the same mass cost. (it was supposed to “compensate” for lack of hives)
			<li>Cybran engineering stations are 10% less efficient than engineers = fewer engineers in game, and more use of hives. Kennels are 30% less efficient than engineers, but can fly. Br on buildings was adjusted to drain more predictable numbers. Drone is cheaper because 250m is too much, given how easy it is to destroy drones.
			<li>sACU build rates decreased to help separate combat presets from eco and field engineer ones, so you can have more choice with the different sACUs. Also helps prevent them reclaiming their own wrecks instantly after/during combat.
			<li>To make the sacrifice system useful: since engineers cost 5x more energy than mass, and most buildings cost 15x more energy than mass, which means that engineers waste more mass than usual since the mass/e ratio is different. Now that is no longer the case. For T3 engineers it’s a smaller increase, because they cost 10x more energy than mass, for sACUs it’s the same, because they cost 30x more energy than mass.

			</ul>
			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>Make energy storages more important, and to separate the good players from the excellent ones.
			<li>Make turtling and ecoing more risky, reward aggressive gameplay, bring a fairer choice between using factory or storage adjacency, nerf the T3 mex so when it’s next to 4 storages it dies to one TML and leaves 100% of its wreck value. Adjacency bonus decreased so you don't have to put storages next to mexes, but still can. HP and price decreased to make the storage better for storage purposes, not just eco.
			<li>Mex Changes:
			<ul>
			<li>T2 mexes cost less mass to get players faster onto T2 eco, where the game becomes more interesting.
			<li>T3 mexes that are cheaper, but less effective especially with combination with less effective storages, this is a nerf to T3 eco, to smoothen the transition between T2/3 mexes.
			</ul>
			<li>To make mass fabricators a more viable option: Their efficiency is the same, but they live longer, and need less power to support them. With storages they have similar efficiency to T3 mexes without storages.
			<li>Fixed the way that you don't need energy storage for economic reasons. The adjacency bonus means that for 3200m in you get 2500e with a T3 pgen, or 2500e and 60 000e storage with 16 storages around a T3 Pgen. Or 600m in storage between 2x T2 Pgen is also +250e bonus.
			<li>To have more consistent numbers, less HP so it gets destroyed with 16 T2 fabs next to it, less explosion damage to prevent chain reactions with multiple T3 Pgens
			<li>Make power generators more important (power snipes), and simply make it less OP. This also helps delay strat rushes and having no choice over whether to get this upgrade when ecoing.

			</ul>
 			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>To make the ACU eventually repairable and work correctly with the new veterancy system.
			<li>To nerf gun to keep it in line with the other changes and keep ranges consistent throughout the mod.
                <ul>
                <li>The turret turn rate helps with microing the acu when it switches targets - makes it nicer to use.
                </ul>
			<li>To make T2/3 units stronger against ACUs
			<li>To make Cybran acu more consistent with the others
			<li>Making T2 more useful for building, and less for fighting, for fighting there is a different upgrade, Aeon and Cybran have more because they can't have range/gun + T2, 
			<li>Price changed for to give a constant drain of 10m/s 200e/s, less HP for reason that HP gain from veteracy multiply and then cause problem with sera nano that will survive nuke. 
			<li>Drains 20m/500e, making it much easier to get without ruining eco or pausing.
			<li>More consistent drain values when upgrading
			<li>Making it harder to kill an enemy ACUs at close ranges with ACU TML, acu tml doesn't destroy tmd
			<li>Aeon upgrades: 
				<ul>
				<li>Chrono: lowered price and effectiveness, making it a safer, more consistent upgrade, hoping that it will be seen more in game, because it’s an interesting option that is underused. 
				</ul>
			<li>UEF upgrades:
				<ul>
				<li>Nano: for more survivability
				<li>Shield: compared to Aeon, it costs less mass but more energy
				<li>Billy: making it a more consistent weapon, where it's easier to defend against, but it's more dangerous against land units
				</ul>
			
			<li>Cybran upgrades:
				<ul>
				<li>Gun: Because the acu lacks HP when compared to other factions
				<li>Laser: For more fluent numbers
				<li>Torpedo upgrade: To nerf Cybran early T2 navy where it's hard to counter torp acu
				<li>Cloak: making it cheaper so it can be used more often, because it’s an interesting part of the game
				</ul>
			
			<li>Sera upgrades:
				<ul>
				<li>Regen field: It's hard to compare to gun, so now its a choice between having a stronger acu, or a stronger army. more HP and regen to allow the acu to stay in fights longer. Reducing max regeneration on advanced restoration field is for a reason: to prevent abuse. BTW: did you know that a single full vet Sera destroyer (surfaced) with an ACU with resto field can quite easily beat a battleship? 
				<li>Heavy gun: To make it used more often in game, because it’s too expensive for normal use.
				</ul>

		<h2>Land</h2>
		
        In this mod land units are adjusted to keep the same purposes but to make gameplay more consistent (less random BS) and make tech level progression not so steep - so you can use lower tech units more effectively later on, rather than having to crtl-k them for mass.
            
            <ul>
			<li>T1 units have more HP, and less dps, in total with the same efficiency, but give more time while they are being killed = can be used as a meat shield for higher tech armies that have a larger range
			<li>T2 units have more concentrated dps in one unit, and have units with special roles
			<li>T3 units have even more concentrated dps and HP in one unit than T2, and have additional units for special roles.
			<li>T4 experimentals have a new build-time, which is 33% of their mass spent on units built from a T3 factory, before was experimental build-time was equal to ~12%.

			</ul>
			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>Making labs usable not only at the start of the game, more speed to be better for raiding; they have had a huge buff, but don’t worry they still lose to tanks in direct combat in larger numbers! However you can now use them with a T1/2 army as well.
				<ul>
				<li>Changed target priorities to something more logical: where you kill radar first, and then ACU for easier ghetto snipes.
				<li>Selen: more maneuverability to be more like a lab and less like a scout and easier way how to use him invisible intel feature where remove repetitive clicking.
				<li>Flare: Capture for possible capture mex instead of destroying. So you can use labs for things other than just raiding for the first 5 minutes. 
				<li>Mech marine: strongest lab, but without any abilities.
				</ul>
			<li>To be able to chase bombers better, survive single bomb and be worth building in the first place, now it can also hit interceptors. 
				<ul>
				<li>The Cybran MAA is also usable like a weaker aurora, with the same range. Homing projectile, because look awesome and whiteout it miss most of shot on long range. Have more AA range because other AA are faster.
				<li>To make it easier to use since you don't need to remember which units are toggled, they auto toggle now.
                <li>This is a fun feature, like mantis repair. It's nearly useless but maybe it can have a creative use sometimes. Their range is reduced in transports so they don't outrange interceptors, and can't kite them.
				</ul>
			<li>T1 Mobile artillery: mostly unchanged, but it needed some adjustments to fit in with the balance and got some quality-of-life changes.
				<ul>
				<li>Medusa: Stun added against T3 units, dps added to make it less annoying to use vs pd, so price is also increased.
				<li>Fervor: Compensating for the aurora losing range, their main advantage on T1, the fervor was made better for use against land units (and acu). 
				<li>Lobo: vision time increased for constant visibility while firing. and give this feature more potential. AOE increased to help it compete with other artillery.
				</ul>
			<li>T1 now tanks live longer, so take a longer time to defend against push. Also can be a better meat shield for higher tech units, so they are more useful in late game.
				<ul>
				<li>Speed decreased to let LABs have more room for raiding.
				<li>Mantis now have a tank icon so you can separate them from labs, which are now usable in your main army. More build rate so the assist feature is used more often, less dps, but better damage per shot. It’s mainly a nerf for Cybran, where they have additional damage from MAA, basically for free now.

            <ol>
			<li>To have consistent and predictable drain values. Deceiver remove this ability to nerf cybran OPnes, while mobile shield also didn't work in transport. 
			<li>AA flak: To make gunships a more useful option, the hover ability is now more expensive. Faction with t2 shield have less HP on flak. Target priority changed to reduce annoying behavior, less range, and more <a href="http://recordit.co/VfcGiVdhbU"> muzzle velocity<a/>  to make them be more reliable.
			<li>MML: Tweak it a bit for make deeper faction diversity
                <ul>
                <li>Sera: This factions trait is to have fewer, more versatile, multifunctional units, such as their T2 destroyers taking on the role of T2 submarines. Their T2 land is not very diverse. This change makes MML also usable against land units on a shorter range, making it follow the factional design philosophy.

                <li>Aeon: Big reload time, is huge disadvantage against tmd, projectile are faster what will help and with more aoe also can do some damage to army. 
                <li>UEF: Camera on UEF T1 artillery is a nice feature, so now its on the MML as well, so you can use it to tell what you are shooting at - complementing the turtle-war specialised faction.

                    </ul> 
                </ul>
			<li>Hover units are better on land, but worse against navy, so they are now a relevant strategic option on land and while not as OP on navy.
			<li>Hoplite slowed down, because hover units are also slower, and they need to be able to catch hoplites.
			<li>Sparky is now a stronger unit that can compete better during the T3 stage, in exchange for a price increase.
			<li>Mongeese don’t miss, making them a very deadly unit, so I decided on a conceptual change to a new unit type, which is in between hoplites and pillars. It adds a  new strategic option that is different than simply using hoplites, and increases faction diversity.
			<li>Rhino turret turn rate increased to make them more consistent when being microed.
			<li>Riptide is made useable on land, has more build time so its harder to spam, what make them less effective against navy.
			<li>Obsidians with their changed target priority are now less vulnerable to OC, because you can now spread them and still focus the ACU.
			<li>Ilshavoh loosen restrictions on its guns so it can shoot closer to itself.
            <li>Fire beetles are more effective against land armies and worse for sniping ACUs, their cloak can be combined with deceivers for a potentially deadly weapon. Use with cloaked moles to confuse the enemy!

			What I tried to achieve with T3 balance is to have a T3 tech which doesn't make T2 units obsolete, but does give an advantage. Currently T1/2 units very quickly become useless as soon as the T3 level is reached, which I think is quite sad since T2 has all the support units that should be used with t3, instead of just brick spam.

            Experimentals in this game were not in the right spot - they were more of a cheese unit than a true experimental. Their incredibly fast build time leads to teams rushing a monkey and the difference between a victory and a mass donation relying on whether the opponent scouts you 10 seconds later, which is not a consistent way of winning the game. Because of this the experimentals are very weak in direct, fair combat. I increased their buildtime and make them less cheese and more strategic instead.
            
            <p>
			Experimentals have roughly 15% less HP than before
            <p>
            The GC, Monkeylord, Megalith, Ythotha and the Fatboy now prioritise the ACU over everything else.

			<ul>
			<li>The face-cannon: muzzle velocity <strike>8</strike> → 10

			<li>Ion storm: friendly fire disabled! <strike>friendly fire 1000dps 20r 0.1aoe, 30s life time</strike> → 400dps 28r 0.5aoe, 45s life time
			<li>AA Weapons: <strike>1.5aoe, 20muzzle-velocity</strike> → 3.5aoe, 20muzzle-velocity

            Galactic Colossus: <strike>27 500m 20 625bt 99 999HP</strike> → 28000m 46 660bt 85 000HP
			<ul>
			<li>Magnet claws now work better and more consistently, they can fire once every 10 seconds, or an equivalent of 600dps per claw when facing bricks/percies (6000HP units). (before they had completely random dps which could be abused to up to 6000dps equivalent and no wrecks)
			</ul>
			
            Fatboy: <strike>21 000bt 32500HP -500e/s 180br</strike> → 46 660bt 35 000HP -250e/s 200br

			<li>  Can now deploy and fire from underwater.
            </ul>
            
			Megalith: <strike>18 750bt 110 000HP 180br 0,5HP/s regen underwater vision 32</strike> → 63 330bt 95 000HP 40br 15HP/s regen underwater vision 45
			<ul>
            <li>Flak <strike> 30dps, 20 muzzle velocity </strike> → 80dps, 55 muzzle velocity
            <li>Torpedo defence reload time <strike>7.7s</strike> → 6.25s
			<li>Megalith egg build times adjusted to the Megalith’s new build rate and units are built 2x faster than in a regular T3 factory.
			</ul>
            
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>T3 units are weaker in this mod (-25%dps -35%HP), so experimentals are changed to maintain balance.
			<li>The Ythotha got more consistent AA weapons, a slightly harder to dodge face-cannon, and price increase due to its much stronger Ion storm which no longer damages allied units.
			<li>The Fatboy had its DPS moved  from long range to short, because T3 units have less HP, and DPS, the short range is less annoying and gives more time for opponents to deal with the fatboy.
			<li>Scathis was a very cheap game ender on small maps, and useless on larger ones. 
				<ul>
				<li>Reworked as a mobile artillery piece, with more versatility but far less destructive power.
				<li>EMP is for supporting allied armies, and to disrupt the enemy.
                <li>It can now mover faster, but is slow to accelearate, like a train.
                <li>It is now able to support navies by firing from underwater - this is only usefull on mostly water maps since on land you can have it shielded, and it is vulnerable to torpedo bombers.
				</ul>
            <li>Megalith flak weapon adjusted to be the same as its mobile flak counterpart.   
			</ol>

            Previously OP, the sACUs have received a much needed rebalance in this mod. Here extra care was taken to ensure that all the presets can be used in various situations, and even sACUs without presets. In general sACUs have a more supporting role and work well when mixed in with T3 units.

			</ul>
			
			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>Price and range reduced to make sACUs weaker without any upgrades, but worth building like presets, opening a new role for sACUs. 
			<li>With reduced buildpower and more time to be reclaimed sACU there is less chance that sACU spam will reclaim anything that dies immediately after the battle.
			<li>The death explosions make sACU spam more risky since it could start a chain reaction, also it’s possible to use as a kamikaze weapon. Damage type changed to prevent teleportation snipes of important buildings by dieing next to them. 
			
			<li>Aeon:
            <ul>
			<li>Sacrifice removed: it was a useless upgrade, and it’s much better to have nano in it’s place so you have a military upgrade on each slot. Now sacrifice is part of the rapid fabricator upgrade.
			</ul>
			
			<li>UEF:
            <ul>
			<li>Jamming is cheaper, because it’s not used often and it buffs pure support sACUs. 
			<li>Gun: nerfed because it was OP. (SACUs are intended as support units, not the most effective combat choice)
			<li>Bubble shields are cheaper and  have better regeneration to increase the use of pure support sACUs.
			</ul>
			
			<li>Cybran:
            <ul>
			<li>Lots of HP and lack of dps: to increase faction diversity, and for AA/EMP that will be stronger without any extra upgrades.
			<li>Stealth: changed to a stealth field, to encourage use as a support sACU.
			<li>EMP: Stun changed to be less OP against T3 units.
			<li>Nano: regeneration decreased because T3 units have less dps.
			<li>Cloak: buffed so it's used more often.
			</ul>
			
			<li>Sera:
            <ul>
			<li>Decreased passive resource generation to make them like the other factions, it was a big buff, and Sera sACUs are already the best fighters so they don’t need another advantage for free. 
			<li>Swapped the positions of the rapid fabricator with teleport so you can have combat engineer sACUs.
			<li>TML is more expensive but has more aoe, and more importantly can store up to 3 missiles which can annihilate an incoming army from huge ranges.
			<li>Overchange: less dps and rof so it's not as OP, more aoe so it's better against units when it fires, range bonus so you don't need to have sensor upgrade for it to be effective, because the default range is 23.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>To re-enable the fuel mechanic which is currently non-existent and to give air staging facilities and carriers a purpose again, leading in general to more selective and locational use of air, rather than just denying all air after 1 fight.
            <li>Airstaging was needed at T1, and was priced like a T1 building, so it was moved there for convenience.
            <li>The free repair prevents them from seizing up when you are stalling, and effectively trapping your aircraft in them.

			</ol>
			
			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Price changed to standardise the factory drain values and to help promote scouting.
            <li>Less energy cost and more mass cost to make tech switching is easier and to encourage each player in a team game to build some air. The speed increase helps catch strats.
            <li>Buffed bombers, to make them easier to use, since they make the game more interesting and to keep them in line since MAA is buffed in this mod. There is now much less reason to hoverbomb since they bombers have a much improved turning circle.
                <ul>
                <li>Removed friendly fire to avoid situations where multiple bombers kill themselves with their own bombs.
                <li>Aeon: Increasing faction diversity, the Aeon bomber is better for single targets, and higher tech units; the emp can also support your army, but it’s less useful for armies on its own, unlike Sera with its large aoe.
                </ul>
            <li>First jester is not an issue, so it can be of a similar mass efficiency to T2 gunships, also the buff helps maintain its effectiveness since T1/2 MAA has been buffed here.
            <li>Transports are underused and make the gameplay more dynamic and interesting, so I tried to encourage transport usage. Speed increased since interceptors have more speed, and they can drop into more dangerous territory now.
                <ul>
                <li>Aeon transport capture ability for more faction diversity, and add a potentially interesting tool and new tactics, such as abducting enemy engineers and helping out during island drops.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>Increased the faction diversity with gunships:
                <ul>
                <li>Spectres are faster because Aeon doesn't have a T2 bomber
                <li>Renegades have  more range because they can't move while firing effectively
                <li>Vulthoos are stronger because Seraphim doesn't have T3 gunships 
                </ul>
			<li>Torpedo Bombers are slightly better with a bit more speed and turn rate. They were given depth charges to make the more consistent, also cleaning up buggy code in the process.
			<li>T2 air needed to be better against T3 air, so T2fighter/bombers cost less, have less ground damage and health, but AA dps is unchanged. Also the Notha firing tolerance changed so it doesn't miss as much. 
                <ul>
                <li>Target priorities changed to make using them less frustrating
                <li>Corsair AA was buffed to be more similar to other T2 bombers (still much worse)
                <li>Swift winds receive more HP to maintain their advantage as the best T2 AA fighter.
                </ul>
			<li>Mercies have been reworked to be better against sniping buildings, and worse for ACU snipes - an ACU moving away will receive only ~30% of the full damage. Crash damage was increased so that the mercy is only 99% useless if it gets shot down and because it makes more sense for a flying bomb to deal some damage on falling.
			<li>Transports got some regeneration to make them reusable without needing to pay attention to repair them (they can't go into air staging facilities), more speed because interceptors are also faster.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            
            <ol>
			<li>Increased faction diversity between Spy planes:
                <ul>
                <li>Cybran added stealth toggle, and energy consumption, so it's in line with the other stealthed aircraft.
                <li>Sera doesn’t have any advanced intel like the other factions ( eye of rihane, Soothsayer, novax) so you can place it in the enemy base similar to Selens.
                </ul>
            <li>ASF were just unbelievably OP. Their price was increased to allow more time for T2 units, before the inevitable ASF swarm arrives. They have less speed, more reload time, less dps to make them less superior (brutally unstoppable with air) and allow T2 air to compete (but still lose), more turret yaw/pitch range to give less random results in air combat (this is the cone where asf can fire). And even after such nerfs they are still superior.
            <li>T3 gunships are a very interesting but underused unit so they got cheaper, with the same effectiveness so you can build them more often (also buffed a bit).
                <ul>
                <li>Cybran got stealth instead of jamming so you can have fully stealthed T3 air, and because it’s a Cybran trait, allowing them to have a fully stealthed t3 air.
                <li>UEF got jamming because it’s more of a UEF trait.
                <li>Aeon restorer is adjusted slightly so it’s the same as before relative to changed air.
                </ul>
            <li>Continental: Less energy consumption and less AA dps  - better than making it stupidly expensive. Its shield bubble is also slightly bigger so it can be combined with T3 gunships and cover them.
            <li>Strats were a bit of a cheese unit so they have less speed and HP so they can be countered with T1/2 air, they got some damage tweaks to make them more consistent, more reload time so they doesn’t destroy mexes too well while hover bombing.
                <ul>
                <li>Cybran strat was nerfed with less survivability and more energy maintenance while stealth is huge advantage and now destroys T2 mex on a single pass like the others.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            

            <ol>
            <li>Wreck: Air experimentals dont live long in enemy territory and so need this change to be able to operate there while giving less of a mass donation. This is the same for ASF in normal FAF.
			<li>Soul Ripper: decreased its mass cost, because it's not much stronger than a GC -  when instant heal doesn't exist air exps are weaker (and are less cheese). More crash damage, because it's a very big unit.  
			<li>Ahwassa: speed reduced so it's easier to catch up to. Also its range was reduced a little so its not so easy to abuse its hover bombing ability to out-range SAMs. Like other air exps, it got a boost to its AA dps, but we were careful not to make it OP, so it has reduced range because of that.
			<li>CZAR: It was a useless unit, that could help only due to its massive crash damage. But the CZAR is an experimental fortress, not a mercy. Massive increases to its HP and AA effectiveness help it be at least a little useful against air, and less against land. Now a CZAR can destroy 50-75% of its own mass in asf. The beam damage was changed to be more effective against buildings, and less against moving land units, and depth charge dps was increased so that they’re not absolutely useless. The CZARs speed was reduced to make it less about cheese and more about strategy, and also helping ground AA counter it (20-25% mass in land AA destroys a CZAR)

            Navy had the best tech level balance in FAF, but there are still some small things which could be ironed out. Several non-naval units were also introduced to the naval game to make it more refreshing and diverse, such as mobile shields.

            Submarines in the naval game are a little underused, and things have been shifted around to make them more useful and interesting. I made every unit useful even on the T3 stage, by using a very old balance model all the way from GPG pre-beta, then making it all work with the help of torpedo defenses.
            <p>
            As a whole, surface warfare is largely unchanged, but submarines and other support units should be seen more often.
            
            <ul>
            <li>All T1 attack submarines are now effective against surface ships. Getting mass T1 sub spam can work all the way into the late T3 stage, but expect to be countered.
            <li>T2 Sub Hunters now actually have the role of hunting subs. They have very low HP and very strong torpedo defense for this purpose, and can kite T1 subs
            <li>Surface ships already have high HP and are now equiped with depth charges, which bypass the sub hunters' torpedo defenses and easily kill them.
            <li>To prevent "great submarine micro" where you stack them all in one spot to increase torpedo defense effectiveness, all torpedoes and depth charges have 0.5AOE. Don't stack your submarines. Just don't.
            <li>All torpedo/depth charge weapons have new target priorities which focus subhunters first. This is because they have their torp defense and the least HP and so are optimal targets.
            <li>As always, Sera being the faction with no units, they are special and have a T1 submarine which is better against subhunters. Their destroyer now has a reason to be submerged; it acts like an attack submarine.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>Frigates are now a powerful intel unit. Other ships rely on them for intel rather than just HP sinks.
                <ul>
                <li>AA nerfed on the Trident Class. The Cybrans have a very solid cruiser and T2 submarines they dont need op frigates anymore.
                <li>The Shard now has more HP, so it doesn't get killed in one pass by torpedo bombers. It also has torpedo defense to help against submarines.
                <li>The Beacon has more range than others but less speed, micro will make it more effective than other frigates.
                </ul>
            <li>T1 Attack submarines get their originally intended role. Their job is to sink ships. And they got some serious buffs to enable that.
                <ul>
                <li>The deck gun range was reduced because it outranged frigates which would have made submarines very strong early game for raiding mexes.
                <li>The Aeon submarine is faster because it doesn’t have a deck gun, which can be a huge disadvantage.
                <li>The Sera submarine is different as usual. It has less HP but torpedo defense to cover up for it. This defense is very strong in large numbers.
                </ul>

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>Sub hunters: They were given their original pre-beta role. Now they really do hunt submarines, due to their extremely powerful torpedo defense, with which they can protect a whole fleet.
                <ul>
                <li>Cooper: Nerfed a little so it's not better against destroyers than a destroyer (when microed).
                </ul>
			<li>Mermaid: These boats provide a huge stealth advantage. The price increase should balance that and the crazy anti-torp stacking they have. Regen added because it can't get veterancy.
			<li>Bulwark: Price changed to standardise factory drain values. Regen added because it can’t get veterancy. Lower range on its shield so you need more bulwarks to completely cover your navy. (its one of the main reasons why UEF navy is OP)
			<li>Cruisers got their price changed to standardise factory drain values.
                <ul>
                <li>Infinity Class: Tiny buff to its tiny ground weapon to help make it more convenient by making it stay further behind due to its larger range.
                <li>Siren Class: Since cybrans don't have shields, their cruiser gets more HP to survive longer vs torps. With more HP, and less dps it will buy more time for the rest of the cybran navy to deal damage, due to the decentralised nature of their AA dps. Since it's also better in surface warfare you can build these more often into your navy, but they are completely defenseless vs submerged threats.
                    <ul>
                    <li>Toggle on its AA removed to fix a poorly implemented function where players can't tell if it's set to engage air or land. Now it will manage itself.
                    </ul>
                <li>The seraphim cruiser got a quality of life change to its flak weapon - more muzzle velocity, less dps to make it more consistent.
                </ul>
            <li>Destroyers got their water vision reduced as part of the submarine rework. They now have more aoe and muzzle velocity so they're able to hit small land units, which were nearly immune to destroyers. They now shoot depth charges which are great against subhunters but their low dps is not good against massed attack submarines. Faster depth-charges projectile to reduce overkill. They got a new strategic icon to help differentiate them from subs, since they're now a lot less anti-naval focused.
                <ul>
                <li>Exodus: aoe increased to fix the lack of a T2 land bombardment unit without messing up naval balance.
                </ul>

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>Aircraft carriers got a water vision adjustment to work better as support ships.
			<li>Submarines sit deeper in the water so it's not as easy to groundfire them; their range was decreased so you can counter them properly instead of groundfire. 
                <ul>
                <li>Strategic submarines are cheaper because they are underused and make the game more fun. Plan B reworked to increase faction diversity and to make it usable against navy, it’s not as good as Sera sub hunters, but it can compete.
                </ul>
            <li>Direct fire ships got a water vision adjustment to let support ship have stronger role on this field.
                <ul>
                <li>Neptune: Price increased to compensate for its power agaisnt T2 navy.
                <li>Torrent has more HP to bring its stats in line with T3 navy. Increased dps to be almost as good as the same mass in UEF/Sera cruisers. More build time to make it more like a T3 unit. It now also has a manual TML launcher that helps give it an edge over T2 Cruiser Bombardment.
                </ul>
            <li>Galaxy has more range so it’s less crap.
			<li>Summit dps and muzzle velocity reduced to make it more balanced against navy.
			<li>Atlantis is faster so it’s not a sea snail. Regen added because every T4 has natural regen. Both the Atlantis and Tempest got special seabed detection code so they don't clip through the floor as much anymore. Because of this in some cases they are more difficult to groundfire.
			<li>Tempest build time increased by a lot (4x), fixed so it's a real experimental - it still loses against equal mass in battleships or subs but now it has a reason to be built, aside from a stupidly fast build time. 
            </ol>

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>T3 Sonar costs more. It was stupidly cheap compared to naval units and intel structures.
			<li>T1 torpedo launchers are much better for killing early submarines. Their depth charges stop sub hunters.
			<li>T2 torpedo launchers get stealth so there is at least some reason to build them. Their HP was increased and they were given depth charged to handle everything that gets in their range.
			<li>The HARMS received a rework to its deployment - now it sinks to the sea floor and deploys there, with extra visual effects. It still fires torpedoes, so it's countered by subhunters, but everything else is in danger. Double mouth of torpedo and half dmg, to work better against torpedo defense.

            <ol>
            <li>T1 PD: It was too strong against T1 tanks when compared to T2 PD.
			<li>T2 PD: Adjusted and standardized the prices and build times so they work with all the land changes.
			<li>T3 PD: Nerfed to maintain balance with the nerfed T3 units. 
			<li>T2 Static Artillery: This unit was nearly useless due to its firing randomness and cost, it was only worth building them against fatboys and in some cases Cybran T2 navy. In this mod they are reworked to be a T2 version of T3 artillery. Very expensive, but can be serious threat for the enemy base or an incoming army. A game ender on 5x5 1v1 maps and a major investment in teamgames. Faction diversity was also increased, where different factions have different artillery. 
			<li>TML: AOE increased to kill storage around mexes when targetting them. It is also better at hitting moving units now, to make using this against armies more viable. The amount of missiles TMLs can store has also been decreased, since you never need 20 and forgetting to disable autobuild will waste eco.
            <li>TMD: FAF balance broke it, we're unbreaking it.
                <ul>
                <li>The Aeon TMD has been (finally) fixed! It will now catch missiles flying over it. They are now the best TMD. However, they trade hp and range for this advantage.

			<li>T2 Flak: Muzzle velocity and AOE increased so flak is usable vs T3 air. Higher cost because of more expensive SAM and mobile flak.

            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Walls: We all know how good they are. Now they have half of their previous HP and are slower to reclaim. (To clear walls you can now use a single pass from a strat, or 2 T2 fighter bombers)
            <li>Shields remain mostly the same, however they now absorb air crash damage, and deflect the smaller wrecks entirely. Another notable change is that the Cybran shield ED4 can now be built at T3, then upgraded once to the ED5 if needed.
            <li>Stealth: Seraphim personal cloak was added so that this building is fully invisible, except for a visual effect. This makes it easier to use offensively since the generator itself is harder to find. To prevent it from being used as a stealth intel system, its visual radius was reduced. It add more faction diversity to game.
            <li>T1/2 Radar: resource adjusted to fit equilibrium's building pattern where units of the same type and tech drain same resources while being built.
            <li>T3 Radar: On the most popular maps its enough to place one somewhere in your back base and its enough to see the whole map. We just made it require a little more strategic placement and use of (gasp) multiple radars on larger maps.
            <li>Perimeter Monitoring System: This is a very expensive and rarely used building, and needed more HP so its harder to snipe and the reclaim doesnt get damaged as much.
            <li>Quantum optics: It's in the same situation as the perimiter monitoring system, so it got the same treatment. We buffed its action radius so it needs fewer clicks to scout the enemy base. Now it needs less initial energy to work, so it doesn't create the all-too-common "why isn't it working" question.

                </ul>    
                

            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Nuke + nuke defence: Build rate and missile build time changed to be able build nuke defence with a loaded missile in time to stop a nuke when the nuke silo is built. It is more easy to assist nuke defence than the nuke launcher, which makes a large difference. 
            <li>T3 artillery: Prices and ranges unified, to avoid situations where you can build Aeon artillery out of range of the enemy artillery. They now have more HP so they can survive a single T3 arty shot from any faction.
            <ul>
                <li>The Salvation was swapped with T3, to increase faction diversity - T3 arty is build more often than game enders. Now Aeon T3 arty is better against armies and worse against bases.
                <li>Likewise, the Emmissary is now more similar to a Mavor, but with lower range and higher dps - it makes much more use of the damage over time mechanic which causes shields to have a hard time recovering.
            </ul>
            <li> The Novax was almost in the right place, it just needed a nudge to make it nicer to use - since its a spy satellite and the uef doesn't have an advanced intel structure (or rather this is it) it got a slight intel boost. And that abuse where you ctrl-k Novaxes to kill SMD, Mavors, arties, ect is fixed. 
            <li> Game enders: Adjusted resource prices for them all to be cheaper. <b>Remember that late game eco has been nerfed!</b>
            </ol>
