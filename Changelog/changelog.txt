v. 35
-----


There were some improvements and rebalances in this version:




- Mobile missile launchers got a balance pass:


- UEF mmls now have a camera on their missiled like the Lobo: 10aoe 5s


-Sera mmls 625hp (850), 2100e(1400)
- It now has a new feature - intelligent missile selection:
- for targets below 38 range it deals half damage but its missiles home in, letting it be used against mobile units to some extent. Just like other units in the seraphim army it is more versatile and has multiple functions now.
-- 400 dmg (405) -> on long range
-- target priority: defence struture -> T2 bot uef cybran ->command ->T3 mobile ->t2 mobile... 


- aeon mmls, 650hp ([750]), energy cost 2100 (1400),
-- dps 60 (55) [60], aoe 1.5 (1), reload time 10s (5s) [10s]
-- missile hp 2 [(1)], speed acceleration 2  [(3)] max speed 10 (12)


- There were some interesting features added to stationary stealth generators, making all four factions have something unique:
-- UEF stealth generator now has a jamming ability, which creates 4 structure blips - disabled by default. Fake T2 PD!
-- Aeon stealth generator also has a new feature - additional armour in its packed (turned off) state: it receives 10x as much HP and a 5/s regen - upon unpacking you keep the same proportion of HP as when it is packed.
-- Sera stealth generator has had selenstyle personal cloak on its building for a while now, and now it has invisible tarmac to match.


- T1 bombers got another balance pass after providing Zock with a mini-mod, which helped get more testing done:
-- tweaked maneuverability a little bit
-- cybran - 3aoe (3,5) [3] + removed useless code
-- sera 4aoe (4,5) [4]
-- improved uef and cybran bombers a little  they should now drop a bit better, although this should be obsolete with the new (finally) bomber fixes with patch 3652.




-Scathis was buffed a bit to be more useable as a mobile artillery piece:
-- movement speed: 3 (2)
-- muzzle velocity: 120 (160) - now its shells get to their targets faster (interestingly).
-- turn radius: 5 (2) to stop it from looking silly while turning at high speeds
-- acceleration: 1 (1.5) puts some weight behind its movemement, making it look like some experimental and not a lab.
-- able to fire from deep underwater




- Air staging drastically improved:
- They now repair for free - this means they don't hog your aircraft anymore if you are stalling mass.
- Aircraft can land on them in greater numbers:


--For UEF/Cybran staging facilities:
--ASF - 4 (1)
--Torpedo Bombers - 4 (2)
--Aeon T3 Torpedo Bomber - 2 (1)
--T3 Spy planes - 4 (2)
--T2 Fighters - 4 (2)
--T2 Gunships - 4 (2)
--T3 Gunships - 2 (1)
--Mercies (still) can't refuel
--Aeon/Sera have 5 docks so everything that can land 4 at a time lands 5 at a time on them.




-Torpedo bombers are a bit nicer to use  they now turn faster (still painfully slow though) but have the same performance.




-Cybran shields got an hp buff to the shield buildings, increasing faction diversity
--ED4 shield code cleaned up (because its directly buildable at t3), and mod made smaller - no gameplay changes




- game enders got a price rebalance to make them a bit more expensive and diverse - dont forget that eco is different in equilibrium so the prices for these should be different also.
-- aeon t3 heavy artillery (200k mass one) got rebalanced a little so its more consistent in its damage - this was done by increasing its damage over time so shields have less chance to recover.
-- aeon t3 heavy artillery had its prjectile improved a little bit - you can now see its damage over time effect better and also now its visible when landing on water.
-- Yolona Oss now has a more diverse price - more energy and less mass cost.
-- Pagaron got a price increase - now it costs the same as in the normal game, but since in there is less mass income its harder to build.


- novax satellite -> fixed a bug in the code
-- speed 8 [6]
-- added 30aoe omni, 150aoe radar (100)
-- aoe 2.5 [1]




Factories got their long awaited hp nerfs so that its a little easier to snipe hqs, and so you need to think about their placement a little more. (also you can always use shields!)

Small tweaks to mex prices:


- T1 mex 30m (20) 300e (250e) 
- T2 mex 6000e (5900e)
- T3 mex 40 000e (38 000e)


Kennels got their prices adjusted as well:
- kennel 1
-- 300m 3000e 750bt (325m 3250e 812,5bt)
- kennel 2 
-- 300m 3000e 1500bt (325m 4875e 1625bt)


Same goes for the level 3 hive:
- hive 3
-- 2750e (4125e)
---> reason: they now have the same price so you can upgrade or build a new building (pros and cons for each choice)


_________
General mod structure, organization and versioning improved a little bit


- removed some useless code, from cybran shield icon: all "gamecommon", "icon" - and everything inside, only icon part from "unitview.lua" now the mod should be smaller in size.
- Mecries had some useless code which was removed.


_________


There were some fixes of both the normal game and the previous version of the mod:




- Solace had a typo in the energy cost which has now been fixed.


- fixed a strange issue with hives and engymod giving them incorrect prices


- there was an issue with support factory prices not working correctly in equilibrium. its fixed now and works just like in the normal game. 
--also fixed the fact that the build time calculations were not being done in engy mod in the base game.


- GC tractor claws were experiencing buggy behavior so they were adjusted to be more consistent & reasonable - now you get the improved version from the base game without it being silly.
-- reload time 10s [0,1s]


- reverted the upgradable building stealth fix  it stopped working at some point in the past and serves no purpose now.
