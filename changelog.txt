- wagner bug fixed (with double dmg on 30dps weapon that was by mistake)

- fixed fire beetle veterancy bug (killed units was not show wreack after kiling by beetle)
- adjusted veterancy threshold - you need 150% of own mass killed to vet up (from 200%)

-- cybran scout price 10m 150e 50bt (15m 225e 75bt)

- titan shield hp reduced from 1100 to 1000 so it has 3000hp in total

- rhino turret turn rate increased slightly so it can be microed nicer, without retarded behaviour
- all acus have a slightly higher turret turn rate, for same reason as rhino
- huge fix to ilshavoh - there was a typo in its name in the bp! also fixed the turret having some silly 70 turn rate, back to 180 like it was before.

____________________________
below is not integrate and is only my note what need to fix somewhere...
___________________________
- sacu preset ikonky


Chrono aby nestunovalo vlastnych


- sera acu advance gun prida +3 range, ale ked ho zrusi range sa nezrusi spet. èo je zle a treba to nejak fixnut. 

- anti nuka, nestava ked stalujes s niecim... 

- transporty kedze enviem fixnut stealth.. tak mozno mu dat jamming. alebo nieco take.. jast idea

- uprav cenu upgradov na sacu a aby boli zaokruhlene cisla




stealt building
-- change units behavior so dont stay visible on radar after reveal
-- visual intel 5 (from 20) for not be effective as intel

musis vyhodit tarmak inak je vidiet ze tam je nejaka budova, rsp bola.. 


- sacu cena za upgrady upratat, aby to malo normalne cisla. a nepolozilo to eko

- t2 torpedo bomber chyba omny radius..
- aeon chronodumper, dont stunn ally units (fixed) - undone  nefunguje to ani u icedreamera 



- stealth na transportoch. 
- wraky aby neignorovali stit. 


- cruiser AA issue,   je taka ze cruiser je sialene silny proti airu,  velmi vela dps ktory nuti air strielat po cruiseri inak death.   
co by mohlo pomoct, je dat dole dps a pridat equivalent hpciek. takze by tam ten air mohol lietat dlhsie

- chrono stunuje ally  - zle som prepisal kod, pozri sa na to viac, musis i pridat aeonske weaoni a nieco tam spravit... 

- aeon t1 AA boat dat mu torp defens ktory i funguje

janus miss issue,  dat mu t1 arty projektil ktory vychne vo vzduchu, a padne dole, aby tolko nemisoval a vypadal super


- cyrbansky teleport ako jediny nema animaciu na mieste portovania..   imho by tam mala byt, bezohladu na to ze je telemazer featura a ju to kazdi... to je dalsi sposob kontroli a skilu ktory to dokaze odhalit. najskor ju len niekto pre to vyhodil. 


- vyries repair. aby nestal mass ale len enegriu. 

RAS a adv RAS  ras 2500m a polovicna ucinnost,   tj vyhoda sa posunie skor. 
cybran stealth spravit advance stealth kedy bude mat aoe efekt ako ma decivet a pridavat nejak 3000hp acucku
cloac potom spravit lacnejsi, a menej hp aby to sedelo. 
- air faktorka roll time ice dreamer zevraj spravil cas stavania enginerou rovnaky na kazdu faktorku. skopiruj a skontroluj

mercina pridat effekt ako ma miasma, 
merrcina pridat velmi kratky stun na jednotky, nefunguje to. neviem preèo


- sera advance gun  pridava +3range a ked sa odstrani range nezmyzne, treba to nejak fixnut. 

- fuel -> aby ked sa minie palivo a 30s bol bez prikazu, aby sa siel automaticky natankovat. 

- skus spravit carrier, aby po pouzití funkcie carrier jednotky mali viac hp, ktory casom klesá az bonus vyprcha. 

- chrono dumper zmenit popis aby bolo jasne ze pridava hp a regen a ze nie je pravda ze je to hight energy consumption
